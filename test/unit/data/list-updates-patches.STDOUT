      Security researcher Amit Klein reported that it was possible to
      reverse engineer the value used to seed Math.random(). Since the
      pseudo-random number generator was only seeded once per browsing
      session, this seed value could be used as a unique token to identify
      and track users across different web sites. (MFSA 2010-33

      Security researcher Ilja van Sprundel of IOActive reported that the 
      Content-Disposition: attachment HTTP header was ignored when
      `Content-Type: multipart` was also present. This issue could
      potentially lead to XSS problems in sites that allow users to upload

      Content-Disposition: attachment to prevent the content from being
      displayed inline. (MFSA 2010-32

      Google security researcher Michal Zalewski reported that focus() 
      could be used to change a user&apos;s cursor focus while they are typing,
      potentially directing their keyboard input to an unintended location.
      This behaviour was also present across origins when content from one
      domain was embedded within another via an iframe. A malicious web
      page could use this behaviour to steal keystrokes from a victim while
      they were typing sensitive information such as a password. (MFSA

      Security researcher Martin Barbella reported via TippingPoint&apos;s Zero
      Day Initiative that an XSLT node sorting routine contained an integer
      overflow vulnerability. In cases where one of the nodes to be sorted
      contained a very large text value, the integer used to allocate a
      memory buffer to store its value would overflow, resulting in too
      small a buffer being created. An attacker could use this

      Security researcher Nils of MWR InfoSecurity reported that the
      routine for setting the text value for certain types of DOM nodes
      contained an integer overflow vulnerability. When a very long string
      was passed to this routine, the integer value used in creating a new

      Microsoft Vulnerability Research reported that two plugin instances
      could interact in a way in which one plugin gets a reference to an
      object owned by a second plugin and continues to hold that reference
      after the second plugin is unloaded and its object is destroyed. In
      these cases, the first plugin would contain a pointer to freed memory
      which, if accessed, could be used by an attacker to execute arbitrary
      code on a victim&apos;s computer. (MFSA 2010-28

      Security researcher Wushi of Team509 reported that the frame
      construction process for certain types of menus could result in a
      menu containing a pointer to a previously freed menu item. During the
      cycle collection process, this freed item could be accessed,
      resulting in the execution of a section of code potentially
      controlled by an attacker. (MFSA 2010-27

      Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability bugs in the
      browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some
      of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
      circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at least some
      of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. (MFSA 2010-26

    * 

      A memory corruption flaw leading to code execution was reported by
      security researcher Nils of MWR InfoSecurity during the 2010 Pwn2Own
      contest sponsored by TippingPoint&apos;s Zero Day Initiative. By moving
      DOM nodes between documents, Nils found a case where the moved node
      incorrectly retained its old scope. If garbage collection could be
      triggered at the right time then Firefox would later use this freed
      object. The exploit only affects Firefox 3.6 and not earlier
      versions. Updated (June 22, 2010): Firefox 3.5, SeaMonkey 2.0, and
      Thunderbird 3.0 based on earlier versions of the browser engine were
      patched just in case there is an alternate way of triggering the
      underlying flaw. (MFSA 2010-25

      Several memory safety bugs in habe been identified in the browser

      An error in the DOM attribute cloning routine has been reported,
      where under certain circumstances an event attribute node can be
      deleted while another object still contains a reference to it. This
      reference could subsequently be accessed, potentially causing the
      execution of attacker controlled memory.

    * 

      An error in Mozilla&apos;s implementation of NodeIterator has been
      reported which can be used to create a malicious NodeFilter to detach
      nodes from the DOM tree while it is being traversed. The use of a
      detached and subsequently deleted node could result in the execution
      of attacker controlled memory.

      An error in the code used to store the names and values of plugin
      parameter elements has been found. A malicious page could embed
      plugin content containing a very large number of parameter elements
      which would cause an overflow in the integer value counting them.
      This integer is later used for allocation of a memory buffer to store
      the plugin parameters. Under such conditions, a buffer that is too
      small would be created and attacker controlled data could be written
      past the end of the buffer, potentially resulting in code execution.

      An array class used to store CSS values contains an integer overflow
      vulnerability. A 16 bit integer used to allocate the memory for the
      array could overflow, resulting in too small a buffer being created.
      When the array is later populated with CSS values, data could be
      written past the end of the buffer, potentially resulting in the

      An integer overflow vulnerability in the implementation of the XUL 
      &lt;tree&gt; element&apos;s selection attribute has been found. When the size of
      a new selection is sufficiently large, the integer used in
      calculating the length of the selection can overflow, resulting in a
      bogus range being marked as selected. When adjustSelection is then
      called on the bogus range, the range is deleted, leaving dangling
      references to the ranges. These could be used by an attacker to call
      into deleted memory and run arbitrary code on a victim&apos;s computer.

      A buffer overflow in Mozilla graphics code which consumes image data
      processed by libpng has been reported. A malformed PNG file could be
      created causing libpng to report an incorrect size of the image. When
      the dimensions of such images are underreported, the Mozilla code
      displaying the graphic will allocate a memory buffer to small to
      contain the image data and will wind up writing data past the end of
      the buffer. This could result in the execution of attacker-controlled
      memory.

      The Web Worker method importScripts can read and parse resources from
      other domains even when the content is not valid JavaScript. This is

    * 

      Two methods for spoofing the content of the location bar have been
      reported. The first method works by opening a new window containing a
      resource that responds with an HTTP 204 (no content) and then using
      the reference to the new window to insert HTML content into the blank
      document. The second location bar spoofing method does not require
      that the resource opened in a new window respond with 204, as long as
      the opener calls window.stop() before the document is loaded. In
      either case a user could be mislead about the correct location of the
      document they are currently viewing.

    * 

      The location bar can be spoofed to look like a secure page even
      though the current document was served via plaintext. The
      vulnerability is triggered by a server by first redirecting a request
      for a plaintext resource to another resource behind a valid SSL/TLS
      certificate. A second request made to the original plaintext resource
      which is responded to not with a redirect, but with JavaScript
      calling history.back() and history.forward() will result in the
      plaintext resource being displayed with a valid SSL/TLS badge in the
      location bar.

    * 

      Data can be read across domains by injecting bogus CSS selectors into
      a target site and then retrieving the data using JavaScript APIs. If
      an attacker can inject opening and closing portions of a CSS selector
      into points A and B of a target page, then the region between the two
      injection points becomes readable to JavaScript through, for example,
      the getComputedStyle() API.

This update for ghostscript fixes the following security issues:

      arbitrary code. (CVE-2010-1869

    * 

      By default, ghostscript reads certain initialization files from the

      DST changes:

          o 

            Africa/Cairo (Egypt) and Asia/Gaza (Palestine) do not use
            daylight saving during the month of Ramadan in order to prevent
            Muslims from fasting one hour longer.

            &lt;http://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/westbank-gaza-end-dst-2010.html&gt;

          o 

            Africa/Casablanca (Marocco) has spent the period from May 2 to
            Aug 8 using daylight saving. Marocco adopted regular daylight
            saving, but the start and end dates vary every year.

            &lt;http://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/morocco-starts-dst-2010.html&gt;

          o 

            America/Argentina/San_Luis (Argentina region) local government
            did not terminate its DST period as planned and instead decided
            to extend its use of the UTC-3 time indefinitely.

            &lt;http://www.worldtimezone.com/dst_news/dst_news_argentina08.html&gt;

    * 

      New zones:

          o America/Bahia_Banderas (Mexican state of Nayarit) has declared
            that it is to follow the UCT-6 time instead of UCT-7, with the
            aim to have the same time as the nearby city of Puerto
            Vallarta.

            &lt;http://www.worldtimezone.com/dst_news/dst_news_mexico08.html&gt;
    * 

      Historical changes:

          o 

            Asia/Taipei information on DST usage listed 1980 as one year
            using DST, which should read 1979 instead according to
            government resources.

          o 

            Europe/Helsinki, before switching to Central European standard
            DST in 1983, trialled DST for two years. However, the database
            omitted to specify that in these trials of 1981 and 1982,
            switches have been made one hour earlier than in 1983.

    * 

      Spelling changes in Micronesia:

          o Pacific/Truk has been renamed to Pacific/Chuuk in 1989.
          o Pacific/Ponape has been renamed to Pacific/Pohnpei in 1984.

      NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the March 2010 CPU.
      Oracle has not commented on claims from a reliable researcher that
      this is for improper parsing of a crafted MIDI stream when creating a
      MixerSequencer object, which causes a pointer to be corrupted and
      allows a NULL byte to be written to arbitrary memory.

  <summary>Security update for Mozilla Firefox  </summary>
  <description>
Mozilla Firefox 3.6 was updated to version 3.6.10, fixing various bugs and 
security issues.

Following security issues were fixed:

    * MFSA 2010-49 / CVE-2010-3169: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
      several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and
      other Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of
      memory corruption under certain circumstances, and we presume that
      with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
      arbitrary code.
    * MFSA 2010-50 / CVE-2010-2765: Security researcher Chris Rohlf of
      Matasano Security reported that the implementation of the HTML
      frameset element contained an integer overflow vulnerability. The
      code responsible for parsing the frameset columns used an 8-byte
      counter for the column numbers, so when a very large number of
      columns was passed in the counter would overflow. When this counter
      was subsequently used to allocate memory for the frameset, the memory
      buffer would be too small, potentially resulting in a heap buffer
      overflow and execution of attacker-controlled memory.
    * MFSA 2010-51 / CVE-2010-2767: Security researcher Sergey Glazunov
      reported a dangling pointer vulnerability in the implementation of
      navigator.plugins in which the navigator object could retain a
      pointer to the plugins array even after it had been destroyed. An
      attacker could potentially use this issue to crash the browser and
      run arbitrary code on a victim&apos;s computer.
    * MFSA 2010-52 / CVE-2010-3131: Security researcher Haifei Li of
      FortiGuard Labs reported that Firefox could be used to load a
      malicious code library that had been planted on a victim&apos;s computer.
      Firefox attempts to load dwmapi.dll upon startup as part of its
      platform detection, so on systems that don&apos;t have this library, such
      as Windows XP, Firefox will subsequently attempt to load the library
      from the current working directory. An attacker could use this
      vulnerability to trick a user into downloading a HTML file and a
      malicious copy of dwmapi.dll into the same directory on their
      computer and opening the HTML file with Firefox, thus causing the
      malicious code to be executed. If the attacker was on the same
      network as the victim, the malicious DLL could also be loaded via a
      UNC path. The attack also requires that Firefox not currently be
      running when it is asked to open the HTML file and accompanying DLL.
      As this is a Windows only problem, it does not affect the Linux
      version. It is listed for completeness only.
    * MFSA 2010-53 / CVE-2010-3166: Security researcher wushi of team509
      reported a heap buffer overflow in code routines responsible for
      transforming text runs. A page could be constructed with a
      bidirectional text run which upon reflow could result in an incorrect
      length being calculated for the run of text. When this value is
      subsequently used to allocate memory for the text too small a buffer
      may be created potentially resulting in a buffer overflow and the
      execution of attacker controlled memory.
    * MFSA 2010-54 / CVE-2010-2760: Security researcher regenrecht reported
      via TippingPoint&apos;s Zero Day Initiative that there was a remaining
      dangling pointer issue leftover from the fix to CVE-2010-2753. Under
      certain circumstances one of the pointers held by a XUL tree
      selection could be freed and then later reused, potentially resulting
      in the execution of attacker-controlled memory.
    * MFSA 2010-55 / CVE-2010-3168: Security researcher regenrecht reported
      via TippingPoint&apos;s Zero Day Initiative that XUL objects could be
      manipulated such that the setting of certain properties on the object
      would trigger the removal of the tree from the DOM and cause certain
      sections of deleted memory to be accessed. In products based on Gecko
      version 1.9.2 (Firefox 3.6, Thunderbird 3.1) and newer this memory
      has been overwritten by a value that will cause an unexploitable
      crash. In products based on Gecko version 1.9.1 (Firefox 3.5,
      Thunderbird 3.0, and SeaMonkey 2.0) and older an attacker could
      potentially use this vulnerability to crash a victim&apos;s browser and
      run arbitrary code on their computer.
    * MFSA 2010-56 / CVE-2010-3167: Security researcher regenrecht reported
      via TippingPoint&apos;s Zero Day Initiative that the implementation of XUL 
      &apos;s content view contains a dangling pointer vulnerability. One of the
      content view&apos;s methods for accessing the internal structure of the
      tree could be manipulated into removing a node prior to accessing it,
      resulting in the accessing of deleted memory. If an attacker can
      control the contents of the deleted memory prior to its access they
      could use this vulnerability to run arbitrary code on a victim&apos;s
      machine.
    * MFSA 2010-57 / CVE-2010-2766: Security researcher regenrecht reported
      via TippingPoint&apos;s Zero Day Initiative that code used to normalize a
      document contained a logical flaw that could be leveraged to run
      arbitrary code. When the normalization code ran, a static count of
      the document&apos;s child nodes was used in the traversal, so a page could
      be constructed that would remove DOM nodes during this normalization
      which could lead to the accessing of a deleted object and potentially
      the execution of attacker-controlled memory.
    * MFSA 2010-58 / CVE-2010-2770: Security researcher Marc Schoenefeld
      reported that a specially crafted font could be applied to a document
      and cause a crash on Mac systems. The crash showed signs of memory
      corruption and presumably could be used by an attacker to execute
      arbitrary code on a victim&apos;s computer.
      This issue probably does not affect the Linux builds and so is listed
      for completeness.
    * MFSA 2010-59 / CVE-2010-2762: Mozilla developer Blake Kaplan reported
      that the wrapper class XPCSafeJSObjectWrapper (SJOW), a security
      wrapper that allows content-defined objects to be safely accessed by
      privileged code, creates scope chains ending in outer objects. Users
      of SJOWs which expect the scope chain to end on an inner object may
      be handed a chrome privileged object which could be leveraged to run
      arbitrary JavaScript with chrome privileges.
      Michal Zalewski&apos;s recent contributions helped to identify this
      architectural weakness.
    * MFSA 2010-60 / CVE-2010-2763: Mozilla security researcher mozbugr_a4
      reported that the wrapper class XPCSafeJSObjectWrapper (SJOW) on the
      Mozilla 1.9.1 development branch has a logical error in its scripted
      function implementation that allows the caller to run the function
      within the context of another site. This is a violation of the
      same-origin policy and could be used to mount an XSS attack.
    * MFSA 2010-61 / CVE-2010-2768: Security researchers David Huang and
      Collin Jackson of Carnegie Mellon University CyLab (Silicon Valley
      campus) reported that the type attribute of an tag can override the
      charset of a framed HTML document, even when the document is included
      across origins. A page could be constructed containing such an tag
      which sets the charset of the framed document to UTF-7. This could
      potentially allow an attacker to inject UTF-7 encoded JavaScript into
      a site, bypassing the site&apos;s XSS filters, and then executing the code
      using the above technique.
    * MFSA 2010-62 / CVE-2010-2769: Security researcher Paul Stone reported
      that when an HTML selection containing JavaScript is copy-and-pasted
      or dropped onto a document with designMode enabled the JavaScript
      will be executed within the context of the site where the code was
      dropped. A malicious site could leverage this issue in an XSS attack
      by persuading a user into taking such an action and in the process
      running malicious JavaScript within the context of another site.
    * MFSA 2010-63 / CVE-2010-2764: Matt Haggard reported that the
      statusText property of an XMLHttpRequest object is readable by the
      requestor even when the request is made across origins. This status
      information reveals the presence of a web server and could be used to
      gather information about servers on internal private networks.
      This issue was also independently reported to Mozilla by Nicholas
      Berthaume

      environment variables allowed local attackers to execute code in
      context of e.g. setuid root programs, elevating privileges.
      This issue does not affect SUSE as an assertion triggers before the
      respective code is executed. The bug was fixed nevertheless.
    * CVE-2010-3856: The LD_AUDIT environment was not pruned during setuid
      root execution and could load shared libraries from standard system
      library paths. This could be used by local attackers to inject code
      into setuid root programs and so elevated privileges.

Additionally a bug in the hconf setup was fixed:

  <description>
This update brings Mozilla Firefox to version 3.6.12, fixing various bugs 
and security issues.

The following security issues were fixed:

    * 

      MFSA 2010-64: Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory
      safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other
      Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory
      corruption under certain circumstances, and we presume that with
      enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
      arbitrary code. References

      Paul Nickerson, Jesse Ruderman, Olli Pettay, Igor Bukanov and Josh
      Soref reported memory safety problems that affected Firefox 3.6 and
      Firefox 3.5.

          o Memory safety bugs - Firefox 3.6, Firefox 3.5
          o CVE-2010-3176

      Gary Kwong, Martijn Wargers and Siddharth Agarwal reported memory
      safety problems that affected Firefox 3.6 only.

          o Memory safety bugs - Firefox 3.6
          o CVE-2010-3175
    * 

      MFSA 2010-65 / CVE-2010-3179: Security researcher Alexander Miller
      reported that passing an excessively long string to document.write
      could cause text rendering routines to end up in an inconsistent
      state with sections of stack memory being overwritten with the string
      data. An attacker could use this flaw to crash a victim&apos;s browser and
      potentially run arbitrary code on their computer.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-66 / CVE-2010-3180: Security researcher Sergey Glazunov
      reported that it was possible to access the locationbar property of a
      window object after it had been closed. Since the closed window&apos;s
      memory could have been subsequently reused by the system it was
      possible that an attempt to access the locationbar property could
      result in the execution of attacker-controlled memory.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-67 / CVE-2010-3183: Security researcher regenrecht reported
      via TippingPoint&apos;s Zero Day Initiative that when window.lookupGetter 
      is called with no arguments the code assumes the top JavaScript stack
      value is a property name. Since there were no arguments passed into
      the function, the top value could represent uninitialized memory or a
      pointer to a previously freed JavaScript object. Under such
      circumstances the value is passed to another subroutine which calls
      through the dangling pointer, potentially executing
      attacker-controlled memory.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-68 / CVE-2010-3177: Google security researcher Robert
      Swiecki reported that functions used by the Gopher parser to convert
      text to HTML tags could be exploited to turn text into executable
      JavaScript. If an attacker could create a file or directory on a
      Gopher server with the encoded script as part of its name the script
      would then run in a victim&apos;s browser within the context of the site.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-69 / CVE-2010-3178: Security researcher Eduardo Vela Nava
      reported that if a web page opened a new window and used a
      javascript: URL to make a modal call, such as alert(), then
      subsequently navigated the page to a different domain, once the modal
      call returned the opener of the window could get access to objects in
      the navigated window. This is a violation of the same-origin policy
      and could be used by an attacker to steal information from another
      web site.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-70 / CVE-2010-3170: Security researcher Richard Moore
      reported that when an SSL certificate was created with a common name
      containing a wildcard followed by a partial IP address a valid SSL
      connection could be established with a server whose IP address
      matched the wildcard range by browsing directly to the IP address. It
      is extremely unlikely that such a certificate would be issued by a
      Certificate Authority.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-71 / CVE-2010-3182: Dmitri Gribenko reported that the
      script used to launch Mozilla applications on Linux was effectively
      including the current working directory in the LDLIBRARYPATH
      environment variable. If an attacker was able to place into the
      current working directory a malicious shared library with the same
      name as a library that the bootstrapping script depends on the
      attacker could have their library loaded instead of the legitimate
      library.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-73 / CVE-2010-3765: Morten Krokvik of Telenor SOC reported
      an exploit targeting particular versions of Firefox 3.6 on Windows XP
      that Telenor found while investigating an intrusion attempt on a
      customer network. The underlying vulnerability, however, was present
      on both the Firefox 3.5 and Firefox 3.6 development branches and
      affected all supported platforms.

      counter for the column numbers, so when a very large number of
      columns was passed in the counter would overflow. When this counter
      was subsequently used to allocate memory for the frameset, the memory
      buffer would be too small, potentially resulting in a heap buffer
      overflow and execution of attacker-controlled memory.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-51 / CVE-2010-2767: Security researcher Sergey Glazunov
      reported a dangling pointer vulnerability in the implementation of
      navigator.plugins in which the navigator object could retain a
      pointer to the plugins array even after it had been destroyed. An
      attacker could potentially use this issue to crash the browser and
      run arbitrary code on a victim&apos;s computer.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-52 / CVE-2010-3131: Security researcher Haifei Li of
      FortiGuard Labs reported that Firefox could be used to load a
      malicious code library that had been planted on a victim&apos;s computer.
      Firefox attempts to load dwmapi.dll upon startup as part of its
      platform detection, so on systems that don&apos;t have this library, such
      as Windows XP, Firefox will subsequently attempt to load the library
      from the current working directory. An attacker could use this
      vulnerability to trick a user into downloading a HTML file and a
      malicious copy of dwmapi.dll into the same directory on their
      computer and opening the HTML file with Firefox, thus causing the
      malicious code to be executed. If the attacker was on the same
      network as the victim, the malicious DLL could also be loaded via a
      UNC path. The attack also requires that Firefox not currently be
      running when it is asked to open the HTML file and accompanying DLL.
      As this is a Windows only problem, it does not affect the Linux
      version. It is listed for completeness only.

      MFSA 2010-53 / CVE-2010-3166: Security researcher wushi of team509
      reported a heap buffer overflow in code routines responsible for
      transforming text runs. A page could be constructed with a
      bidirectional text run which upon reflow could result in an incorrect
      length being calculated for the run of text. When this value is
      subsequently used to allocate memory for the text too small a buffer
      may be created potentially resulting in a buffer overflow and the
      execution of attacker controlled memory.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-54 / CVE-2010-2760: Security researcher regenrecht reported
      via TippingPoint&apos;s Zero Day Initiative that there was a remaining
      dangling pointer issue leftover from the fix to CVE-2010-2753. Under
      certain circumstances one of the pointers held by a XUL tree
      selection could be freed and then later reused, potentially resulting
      in the execution of attacker-controlled memory.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-55 / CVE-2010-3168: Security researcher regenrecht reported
      via TippingPoint&apos;s Zero Day Initiative that XUL objects could be
      manipulated such that the setting of certain properties on the object
      would trigger the removal of the tree from the DOM and cause certain
      sections of deleted memory to be accessed. In products based on Gecko
      version 1.9.2 (Firefox 3.6, Thunderbird 3.1) and newer this memory
      has been overwritten by a value that will cause an unexploitable
      crash. In products based on Gecko version 1.9.1 (Firefox 3.5,
      Thunderbird 3.0, and SeaMonkey 2.0) and older an attacker could
      potentially use this vulnerability to crash a victim&apos;s browser and
      run arbitrary code on their computer.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-56 / CVE-2010-3167: Security researcher regenrecht reported
      via TippingPoint&apos;s Zero Day Initiative that the implementation of
      XUL&apos;s content view contains a dangling pointer vulnerability. One of
      the content view&apos;s methods for accessing the internal structure of
      the tree could be manipulated into removing a node prior to accessing
      it, resulting in the accessing of deleted memory. If an attacker can
      control the contents of the deleted memory prior to its access they
      could use this vulnerability to run arbitrary code on a victim&apos;s
      machine.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-57 / CVE-2010-2766: Security researcher regenrecht reported
      via TippingPoint&apos;s Zero Day Initiative that code used to normalize a
      document contained a logical flaw that could be leveraged to run
      arbitrary code. When the normalization code ran, a static count of
      the document&apos;s child nodes was used in the traversal, so a page could
      be constructed that would remove DOM nodes during this normalization
      which could lead to the accessing of a deleted object and potentially
      the execution of attacker-controlled memory.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-58 / CVE-2010-2770: Security researcher Marc Schoenefeld
      reported that a specially crafted font could be applied to a document
      and cause a crash on Mac systems. The crash showed signs of memory
      corruption and presumably could be used by an attacker to execute
      arbitrary code on a victim&apos;s computer. This issue probably does not
      affect the Linux builds and so is listed for completeness.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-59 / CVE-2010-2762: Mozilla developer Blake Kaplan reported
      that the wrapper class XPCSafeJSObjectWrapper (SJOW), a security
      wrapper that allows content-defined objects to be safely accessed by
      privileged code, creates scope chains ending in outer objects. Users
      of SJOWs which expect the scope chain to end on an inner object may
      be handed a chrome privileged object which could be leveraged to run
      arbitrary JavaScript with chrome privileges. Michal Zalewski&apos;s recent
      contributions helped to identify this architectural weakness.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-60 / CVE-2010-2763: Mozilla security researcher mozbugr_a4
      reported that the wrapper class XPCSafeJSObjectWrapper (SJOW) on the
      Mozilla 1.9.1 development branch has a logical error in its scripted
      function implementation that allows the caller to run the function
      within the context of another site. This is a violation of the
      same-origin policy and could be used to mount an XSS attack.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-61 / CVE-2010-2768: Security researchers David Huang and
      Collin Jackson of Carnegie Mellon University CyLab (Silicon Valley
      campus) reported that the type attribute of an tag can override the
      charset of a framed HTML document, even when the document is included
      across origins. A page could be constructed containing such an tag
      which sets the charset of the framed document to UTF-7. This could
      potentially allow an attacker to inject UTF-7 encoded JavaScript into
      a site, bypassing the site&apos;s XSS filters, and then executing the code
      using the above technique.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-62 / CVE-2010-2769: Security researcher Paul Stone reported
      that when an HTML selection containing JavaScript is copy-and-pasted
      or dropped onto a document with designMode enabled the JavaScript
      will be executed within the context of the site where the code was
      dropped. A malicious site could leverage this issue in an XSS attack
      by persuading a user into taking such an action and in the process
      running malicious JavaScript within the context of another site.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-63 / CVE-2010-2764: Matt Haggard reported that the
      statusText property of an XMLHttpRequest object is readable by the
      requestor even when the request is made across origins. This status
      information reveals the presence of a web server and could be used to
      gather information about servers on internal private networks. This
      issue was also independently reported to Mozilla by Nicholas
      Berthaume.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-64: Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory
      safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other
      Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory
      corruption under certain circumstances, and we presume that with
      enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
      arbitrary code. References

      Paul Nickerson, Jesse Ruderman, Olli Pettay, Igor Bukanov and Josh
      Soref reported memory safety problems that affected Firefox 3.6 and
      Firefox 3.5.

          o Memory safety bugs - Firefox 3.6, Firefox 3.5
          o CVE-2010-3176

      Jesse Ruderman reported a crash which affected Firefox 3.5 only.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-65 / CVE-2010-3179: Security researcher Alexander Miller
      reported that passing an excessively long string to document.write
      could cause text rendering routines to end up in an inconsistent
      state with sections of stack memory being overwritten with the string
      data. An attacker could use this flaw to crash a victim&apos;s browser and
      potentially run arbitrary code on their computer.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-66 / CVE-2010-3180: Security researcher Sergey Glazunov
      reported that it was possible to access the locationbar property of a
      window object after it had been closed. Since the closed window&apos;s
      memory could have been subsequently reused by the system it was
      possible that an attempt to access the locationbar property could
      result in the execution of attacker-controlled memory.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-67 / CVE-2010-3183: Security researcher regenrecht reported
      via TippingPoint&apos;s Zero Day Initiative that when window.lookupGetter 
      is called with no arguments the code assumes the top JavaScript stack
      value is a property name. Since there were no arguments passed into
      the function, the top value could represent uninitialized memory or a
      pointer to a previously freed JavaScript object. Under such
      circumstances the value is passed to another subroutine which calls
      through the dangling pointer, potentially executing
      attacker-controlled memory.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-68 / CVE-2010-3177: Google security researcher Robert
      Swiecki reported that functions used by the Gopher parser to convert
      text to HTML tags could be exploited to turn text into executable
      JavaScript. If an attacker could create a file or directory on a
      Gopher server with the encoded script as part of its name the script
      would then run in a victim&apos;s browser within the context of the site.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-69 / CVE-2010-3178: Security researcher Eduardo Vela Nava
      reported that if a web page opened a new window and used a
      javascript: URL to make a modal call, such as alert(), then
      subsequently navigated the page to a different domain, once the modal
      call returned the opener of the window could get access to objects in
      the navigated window. This is a violation of the same-origin policy
      and could be used by an attacker to steal information from another
      web site.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-70 / CVE-2010-3170: Security researcher Richard Moore
      reported that when an SSL certificate was created with a common name
      containing a wildcard followed by a partial IP address a valid SSL
      connection could be established with a server whose IP address
      matched the wildcard range by browsing directly to the IP address. It
      is extremely unlikely that such a certificate would be issued by a
      Certificate Authority.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-71 / CVE-2010-3182: Dmitri Gribenko reported that the
      script used to launch Mozilla applications on Linux was effectively
      including the current working directory in the LDLIBRARYPATH
      environment variable. If an attacker was able to place into the
      current working directory a malicious shared library with the same
      name as a library that the bootstrapping script depends on the
      attacker could have their library loaded instead of the legitimate
      library.

This is a collective udev update with the following changes:

    * This update changes udev to no longer try to &apos;rmdir /dev/.udev/&apos; when
      it is unnecessary as it casues noticeable slowdowns in the kernel VFS
    * It removes a patch that sorted the device list as it caused

  <description>
The openslp daemon could run into an endless loop when receiving specially 
crafted packets (CVE-2010-3609). This has been fixed.

Additionally the following non-security bugs were fixed:

    * 564504: Fix handling of DA answers if both active and passive DA
      detection is off
    * 597215: Add configuration options to openSLP: net.slp.DASyncReg makes
      slpd query statically configured DAs for registrations,
      net.slp.isDABackup enables periodic writing of remote registrations
      to a backup file which is also read on startup. Both options can be
      used to decrease the time between the start of the slpd daemon and
      slpd knowing all registrations.
    * 601002: reduce CPU usage spikes on machines with many connections by
      using the kernel netlink interface instead of reading the /proc
      filesystem.
    * 626444: Standard compliance was fixed by stripping leading and
      trailing white spaces when doing string comparisons of scopes.

  <summary>Security update for Mozilla Firefox  </summary>
  <description>
Mozilla Firefox 3.6 was updated to update 3.6.13 fixing several security 
issues.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-74: Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory
      safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other
      Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory
      corruption under certain circumstances, and we presume that with
      enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
      arbitrary code.

      Jesee Ruderman, Andreas Gal, Nils, and Brian Hackett reported memory
      safety problems that affected Firefox 3.6 and Firefox 3.5.
      (CVE-2010-3776)

      Igor Bukanov reported a memory safety problem that was fixed in
      Firefox 3.6 only. (CVE-2010-3777)

      Jesse Ruderman reported a crash which affected Firefox 3.5 only.
      (CVE-2010-3778)

    * 

      MFSA 2010-75 / CVE-2010-3769: Dirk Heinrich reported that on Windows
      platforms when document.write() was called with a very long string a
      buffer overflow was caused in line breaking routines attempting to
      process the string for display. Such cases triggered an invalid read
      past the end of an array causing a crash which an attacker could
      potentially use to run arbitrary code on a victim&apos;s computer.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-76 / CVE-2010-3771: Security researcher echo reported that
      a web page could open a window with an about:blank location and then
      inject an

      element into that page which upon submission would redirect to a
      chrome: document. The effect of this defect was that the original
      page would wind up with a reference to a chrome-privileged object,
      the opened window, which could be leveraged for privilege escalation
      attacks.

      Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 provided proof-of-concept
      code demonstrating how the above vulnerability could be used to run
      arbitrary code with chrome privileges.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-77 / CVE-2010-3772: Security researcher wushi of team509
      reported that when a XUL tree had an HTML

      element nested inside a element then code attempting to display
      content in the XUL tree would incorrectly treat the
      element as a parent node to tree content underneath it resulting in
      incorrect indexes being calculated for the child content. These
      incorrect indexes were used in subsequent array operations which
      resulted in writing data past the end of an allocated buffer. An
      attacker could use this issue to crash a victim&apos;s browser and run
      arbitrary code on their machine.

      via TippingPoint&apos;s Zero Day Initiative that JavaScript arrays were
      vulnerable to an integer overflow vulnerability. The report
      demonstrated that an array could be constructed containing a very
      large number of items such that when memory was allocated to store
      the array items, the integer value used to calculate the buffer size
      would overflow resulting in too small a buffer being allocated.
      Subsequent use of the array object could then result in data being

      in a network or certificate error page, the opening site could access
      the document inside the opened window and inject arbitrary content.
      An attacker could use this bug to spoof the location bar and trick a

      and Masatoshi Kimura reported that the x-mac-arabic, x-mac-farsi and
      x-mac-hebrew character encodings are vulnerable to XSS attacks due to
      some characters being converted to angle brackets when displayed by
      the rendering engine. Sites using these character encodings would
      thus be potentially vulnerable to script injection attacks if their

  <summary>Security update for Mozilla XULrunner  </summary>
  <description>
Mozilla XULRunner 1.9.1 was updated to update 1.9.1.16 fixing several 
security issues.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-74: Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory
      safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other
      Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory
      corruption under certain circumstances, and we presume that with
      enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
      arbitrary code.

      Jesee Ruderman, Andreas Gal, Nils, and Brian Hackett reported memory
      safety problems that affected Firefox 3.6 and Firefox 3.5.
      (CVE-2010-3776)

      Igor Bukanov reported a memory safety problem that was fixed in
      Firefox 3.6 only. (CVE-2010-3777)

      Jesse Ruderman reported a crash which affected Firefox 3.5 only.
      (CVE-2010-3778)

    * 

      MFSA 2010-75 / CVE-2010-3769: Dirk Heinrich reported that on Windows
      platforms when document.write() was called with a very long string a
      buffer overflow was caused in line breaking routines attempting to
      process the string for display. Such cases triggered an invalid read
      past the end of an array causing a crash which an attacker could
      potentially use to run arbitrary code on a victim&apos;s computer.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-76 / CVE-2010-3771: Security researcher echo reported that
      a web page could open a window with an about:blank location and then
      inject an

      element into that page which upon submission would redirect to a
      chrome: document. The effect of this defect was that the original
      page would wind up with a reference to a chrome-privileged object,
      the opened window, which could be leveraged for privilege escalation
      attacks.

      Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 provided proof-of-concept
      code demonstrating how the above vulnerability could be used to run
      arbitrary code with chrome privileges.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-77 / CVE-2010-3772: Security researcher wushi of team509
      reported that when a XUL tree had an HTML

      element nested inside a element then code attempting to display
      content in the XUL tree would incorrectly treat the
      element as a parent node to tree content underneath it resulting in
      incorrect indexes being calculated for the child content. These
      incorrect indexes were used in subsequent array operations which
      resulted in writing data past the end of an allocated buffer. An
      attacker could use this issue to crash a victim&apos;s browser and run
      arbitrary code on their machine.

  <summary>Security update for postgresql  </summary>
  <description>
This update of postgresql fixes several minor security vulnerabilities:

    * Postgresql does not properly check privileges during certain RESET
      ALL operations, which allows remote authenticated users to remove
      arbitrary parameter settings. (CVE-2010-1975
      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-1975&gt; )
    * The PL/Tcl implementation in postgresql loads Tcl code from the 
      pltcl_modules table regardless of the table&apos;s ownership and
      permissions, which allows remote authenticated users with database
      creation privileges to execute arbitrary Tcl code. (CVE-2010-1170
      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-1170&gt; )
    * Postgresql does not properly restrict PL/perl procedures, which
      allows remote authenticated users with database creation privileges
      to execute arbitrary Perl code via a crafted script. (CVE-2010-1169
      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-1169&gt; )
    * An integer overflow in postgresql allows remote authenticated users
      to crash the daemon with a SELECT statement. (CVE-2010-0733
      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-0733&gt; )

  <summary>Recommended update for kiwi  </summary>
  <description>
This is a collective update for kiwi which includes the following fixes:

    * Call dhcpcd with the option --noipv4ll to be able to check the return
      code of dhcpcd and to prevent the interface from an ip address if
      there was a DHCP timeout (bnc #634057)
    * if a fixed xml size was set for a filesystem image, make use of it
      even if kiwi&apos;s calculation says it&apos;s too small. This allows users to
      create the image with less or no free space but also could cause the
      image to fail because of no space left on device. We don&apos;t use the
      fixed xml size if it&apos;s too small for a virtual disk based image
      though because this could cause the image to be created successfully
      but then failed on boot which is a bad user experience (bnc #627031)
    * Fix Progress bar not moving during partition writing stage of initial
      unbundle (bnc#600710)
    * Avoid that kiwi overwrites /etc/sysconfig/firstboot (bnc#604705)
    * Don&apos;t remove updates/weak-updates modules in boot images (bnc#609879)
    * Remove temporary directories even if repo has a &quot;.&quot; in its name
      (bnc#619482)
    * Fix Locale warning &quot;Gtk-WARNING **: Locale not supported by C
      library.&quot;
    * Fix failure to install pxe-format image using sles10 template on
      hardware (bnc#636121)
    * Add support for 4k-sector size disks (bnc#637333)
    * Create correct baseproduct symlink if more than one product is
      installed (bnc#637996)
    * Fix &quot;Failed to find MBR identifier&quot; after second boot from USB stick
      (bnc#654617)
    * Add a check for preserving the first sector start after
      repartitioning (bnc#659865)
    * Fix inclusion of recovery tarball if a relative destination was
      specified (bnc#663779)
    * don&apos;t remove libresolv and libnss_dns from initrd (bnc #664593)
    * fixed bootstick deployment, don&apos;t remove existing boot data
      (bnc#654617)

  <summary>Recommended update for OpenSLP  </summary>
  <description>
This update adds the new option net.slp.hardMTU to OpenSLP to control the 
size of datagrams sent by the server. With hardMTU turned on, the server 
truncates its answers at 1400 bytes. This can break old or unpatched 
versions of SLP clients that are just looking at the size of the packages 
to detect overflows. For this reason, hardMTU is set to false by default. 
It may be enabled if a router silently drops oversize SLP packets.

The update also fixed an slpd crash caused by a double free() call when a 
DA advertises an invalid url.

  <description>
IBM Java 1.4.2 SR13 was updated to FP8 to fix various bugs and security 
issues.

Following security issues were fixed:

    * 

      CVE-2010-1321: The kg_accept_krb5 function in
      krb5/accept_sec_context.c in the GSS-API library in MIT Kerberos 5
      (aka krb5) through 1.7.1 and 1.8 before 1.8.2, as used in kadmind and
      other applications, does not properly check for invalid GSS-API
      tokens, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of
      service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via an AP-REQ
      message in which the authenticator&apos;s checksum field is missing.

    * 

      CVE-2010-3574: Unspecified vulnerability in the Networking component
      in Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 21, 5.0 Update 25,
      1.4.2_27, and 1.3.1_28 allows remote attackers to affect
      confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors.
      NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the October 2010
      CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims from a reliable downstream
      vendor that HttpURLConnection does not properly check for the
      allowHttpTrace permission, which allows untrusted code to perform
      HTTP TRACE requests.

    * 

      CVE-2010-4476: The Java Runtime Environment hangs forever when
      converting &quot;2.2250738585072012e-308&quot; to a binary floating-point

  <description>
Mozilla Firefox has been updated to version 3.6.15, fixing the following 
security issues:

    * 

      Several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and
      other Mozilla-based products have been identified and fixed. Some of
      these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
      circumstances, and it is assumed that with enough effort at least
      some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. (MFSA 2011-01
      / CVE-2011-0053
      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0053&gt; , 
      CVE-2011-0062
      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0062&gt; )

    * 

      A recursive call to eval() wrapped in a try/catch statement places
      the browser into a inconsistent state. Any dialog box opened in this
      state is displayed without text and with non-functioning buttons.
      Closing the window causes the dialog to evaluate to true. An attacker
      could use this issue to force a user into accepting any dialog, such
      as one granting elevated privileges to the page presenting the
      dialog. (MFSA 2011-02 / CVE-2011-0051
      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0051&gt; )

    * 

      A method used by JSON.stringify contains a use-after-free error in
      which a currently in-use pointer was freed and subsequently
      dereferenced. This could lead to arbitrary code execution if an
      attacker is able to store malicious code in the freed section of
      memory. (MFSA 2011-03 / CVE-2011-0055
      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0055&gt; )

    * 

      The JavaScript engine&apos;s internal memory mapping of non-local JS
      variables contains a buffer overflow which could potentially be used
      by an attacker to run arbitrary code on a victim&apos;s computer. (MFSA
      2011-04 / CVE-2011-0054
      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0054&gt; )

    * 

      The JavaScript engine&apos;s internal mapping of string values contains an
      error in cases where the number of values being stored is above 64K.
      In such cases an offset pointer is manually moved forwards and
      backwards to access the larger address space. If an exception is
      thrown between the time that the offset pointer was moved forward and
      the time it gets reset, the exception object would be read from an
      invalid memory address, potentially executing attacker-controlled
      memory. (MFSA 2011-05 / CVE-2011-0056
      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0056&gt; )

    * 

      A JavaScript Worker could be used to keep a reference to an object
      that could be freed during garbage collection. Subsequent calls
      through this deleted reference could cause attacker-controlled memory
      to be executed on a victim&apos;s computer. (MFSA 2011-06 / CVE-2011-0057
      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0057&gt; )

    * 

      When very long strings are constructed and inserted into an HTML
      document, the browser incorrectly constructs the layout objects used
      to display the text. Under such conditions an incorrect length would
      be calculated for a text run resulting in too small of a memory
      buffer being allocated to store the text. This issue could be used by
      an attacker to write data past the end of the buffer and execute
      malicious code on a victim&apos;s computer. It affects only Mozilla
      browsers on Windows. (MFSA 2011-07 / CVE-2011-0058
      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0058&gt; )

    * 

      ParanoidFragmentSink, a class used to sanitize potentially unsafe
      HTML for display, allows javascript: URLs and other inline JavaScript
      when the embedding document is a chrome document. While there are no
      unsafe uses of this class in any released products, extension code
      could potentially use it in an unsafe manner. (MFSA 2011-08 / 
      CVE-2010-1585
      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-1585&gt; )

    * 

      A JPEG image can be constructed that will be decoded incorrectly,
      causing data to be written past the end of a buffer created to store
      the image. An attacker could potentially craft such an image that
      would cause malicious code to be stored in memory and then later
      executed on a victim&apos;s computer. (MFSA 2011-09 / CVE-2011-0061
      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0061&gt; )

    * 

      When plugin-initiated requests receive a 307 redirect response, the
      plugin is not notified and the request is forwarded to the new
      location. This is true even for cross-site redirects, so any custom
      headers that were added as part of the initial request would be
      forwarded intact across origins. This poses a CSRF risk for web
      applications that rely on custom headers only being present in
      requests from their own origin. (MFSA 2011-10 / CVE-2011-0059
      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0059&gt; )

The Olson timezone database has been updated to version 2011c:

This package update contains the following DST-related changes:

    * Pacific/Fiji will end DST 3 weeks earlier than expected - on March 6,
      2011, not March 27, 2011.
    * Pacific/Apia will switch from WSDT to WST on Apr 3; however, the
      precise time of the switch has been incorrect in previous version.
    * Chile (America/Santiago, Pacific/Easter) will postpone the end of DST
      by a month again, this time to help dealing with the water shortage;
      the DST will end on April 3, 2011, not March 13, 2011.

These new zones have been introduced:

    * Mercer County, North Dakota (America/North_Dakota/Beulah) switched
      from the mountain time zone to the central time zone at the last
      transition from daylight-saving to standard time (on Nov. 7, 2010).
    * Detailed information on time changes in some Indian reservations in
      Alaska has been discovered, leading to split of new timezones
      America/Sitka and America/Metlakatla off America/Juneau.

Historical time information has been adjusted for these zones:

    * America/Juneau has been adjusted in accordance with the discovered
      information on Alaska time history.
    * Asia/Hong_Kong declared that daylight saving was used in year 1977,
      while in fact it was not.
    * South Australia (Australia/Adelaide, Australia/Broken_Hill)
      definitions have been cleaned up; the zone binary data changed but
      not the interpretation.
    * Pacific/Honolulu has been corrected to correctly define abandonment
      of local mean time as of 1896 and DST usage between 1942 and 1945.

  <description>
The build script uses cpio to extract untrusted rpm packages for 
bootstrapping virtual machines. cpio is not safe to use for this task, 
therefore the build script now uses bsdtar instead (CVE-2010-4226).

  <summary>Recommended update for iproute2  </summary>
  <description>
This update of the &quot;ip&quot; program in iproute2 removes a SUSE specific patch 
for setting the fragmentation timeout option which requires a part in the 
kernel that is no longer available.

Afterwards setting rto\_min times is possible again. It also corrects 
conversion of raw rto\_min,rtt,rttvar values into ms (bnc#659746).

  <summary>Security update for FUSE  </summary>
  <description>
The following security issues were fixed:

    * CVE-2010-3879: FUSE allowed local users to create mtab entries with
      arbitrary pathnames, and consequently unmount any filesystem, via a
      symlink attack on the parent directory of the mountpoint of a FUSE
      filesystem.
    * CVE-2011-0541: Avoid mounting a directory including evaluation of
      symlinks, which might have allowed local attackers to mount
      filesystems anywhere in the system.
    * CVE-2011-0543: Avoid symlink attacks on the mount point written in
      the mtab file.

Four bugs were fixed:

    * fixed retrying nfs mounts on rpc timeouts
    * allow seperate control of the internet protocol uses by rpc.mount
      seperately of the protocol used by nfs.
    * Fixed locking in libuuid/uuid to avoid duplicate uuids.
    * mkswap bad block check marked every block bad in O(n!) time on a good
      device

New features were implemented:

    * mount now has --fake and --no-canonicalize options, required for the
      symlink security fixes. These were backported from mainline.
    * mount can now auto-detect and differentiate between squashfs3 and
      squashfs (v4) filesystems, allowing backward compatibility to the
      SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 GA codebase.

  <description>
This update fixes the Expression Language parser.

The parser was previously unable parse expressions without additional 
whitespaces - like &apos;${not(true)}&apos;. This is addressed in apache bug #45511. 
And the last character of namespace is lost during a parsing, which makes 
this feature unusable. This is apache bug #45648. Both issues are fixed by 
this update.

      reported that the resource: protocol could be exploited to allow
      directory traversal on Windows and the potential loading of resources
      from non-permitted locations. The impact would depend on whether
      interesting files existed in predictable locations in a useful
      format. For example, the existence or non-existence of particular
      images might indicate whether certain software was installed.

      reported that the XSLT generate-id() function returned a string that
      revealed a specific valid address of an object on the memory heap. It
      is possible that in some cases this address would be valuable
      information that could be used by an attacker while exploiting a
      different memory corruption but, in order to make an exploit more
      reliable or work around mitigation features in the browser or
      operating system.

    * 

      MFSA 2011-18 / CVE-2011-1202: Chris Evans of the Chrome Security Team
      reported that the XSLT generate-id() function returned a string that
      revealed a specific valid address of an object on the memory heap. It
      is possible that in some cases this address would be valuable
      information that could be used by an attacker while exploiting a
      different memory corruption but, in order to make an exploit more
      reliable or work around mitigation features in the browser or
      operating system.

This patch fixes two bugs in libslp:

    * openslp requests fail if an old handle is reused and the server
      closed the connection in the meantime. If the request is retried, it
      works.
    * In the scenario above, even retries will fail if the connection
      socket happens to use file descriptor zero.

The patch also doubles the maximum allowed connection count for slpd.

  <summary>Security update for Mozilla Firefox  </summary>
  <description>
Mozilla Firefox was updated to version 3.6.20.

It fixes bugs and security issues. Following security issues were fixed: 
Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2011-30 - MFSA 2011-30
&lt;http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2011/mfsa2011-30.html&gt;

    * 

      Miscellaneous memory safety hazards

      Mozilla developers and community members identified and fixed several
      memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox 3.6 and
      other Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of
      memory corruption under certain circumstances, and we presume that
      with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
      arbitrary code.

      Gary Kwong, Igor Bukanov, Nils and Bob Clary reported memory safety
      issues which affected Firefox 3.6. (CVE-2011-2982)

    * 

      Crash in SVGTextElement.getCharNumAtPosition()

      Security researcher regenrecht reported via TippingPoint&apos;s Zero Day
      Initiative that a SVG text manipulation routine contained a dangling
      pointer vulnerability. (CVE-2011-0084)

    * 

      Privilege escalation using event handlers

      Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a_4 reported a vulnerability in
      event management code that would permit JavaScript to be run in the
      wrong context, including that of a different website or potentially
      in a chrome-privileged context. (CVE-2011-2981)

    * 

      Dangling pointer vulnerability in appendChild

      Security researcher regenrecht reported via TippingPoint&apos;s Zero Day
      Initiative that appendChild did not correctly account for DOM objects
      it operated upon and could be exploited to dereference an invalid
      pointer. (CVE-2011-2378)

    * 

      Privilege escalation dropping a tab element in content area

      Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reported that web content
      could receive chrome privileges if it registered for drop events and
      a browser tab element was dropped into the content area.
      (CVE-2011-2984)

    * 

      Binary planting vulnerability in ThinkPadSensor::Startup

      Security researcher Mitja Kolsek of Acros Security reported that
      ThinkPadSensor::Startup could potentially be exploited to load a
      malicious DLL into the running process. (CVE-2011-2980) (This issue
      is likely Windows only)

    * 

      Private data leakage using RegExp.input

      Security researcher shutdown reported that data from other domains
      could be read when RegExp.input was set. (CVE-2011-2983)

  <summary>Security update for Apache  </summary>
  <description>
This update fixes a remote denial of service bug (memory exhaustion) in the 
Apache 2 HTTP server, that could be triggered by remote attackers using 
multiple overlapping Request Ranges. (CVE-2011-3192)

It also fixes a issue in mod_dav, where the (1) mod_cache and (2) mod_dav 
modules in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x allowed remote attackers to cause a 
denial of service (process crash) via a request that lacks a path. 
(CVE-2010-1452)

Also following bugs were fixed:

    * recommend the default MPM (prefork) via Recommends: in .spec
    * apache not sending error 304 if mod_deflate is enabled.
    * take LimitRequestFieldsize config option into account when parsing
      headers from backend.

  <description>
Mozilla Firefox was updated to version 3.6.23, fixing various bugs and 
security issues.

    * 

      MFSA 2011-36: Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory
      safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other
      Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory
      corruption under certain circumstances, and we presume that with
      enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
      arbitrary code.

      In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
      Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled,,
      but are potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in
      those products.

      Benjamin Smedberg, Bob Clary, and Jesse Ruderman reported memory
      safety problems that affected Firefox 3.6 and Firefox 6.
      (CVE-2011-2995)

      Josh Aas reported a potential crash in the plugin API that affected
      Firefox 3.6 only. (CVE-2011-2996)

    * 

      MFSA 2011-37: Mark Kaplan reported a potentially exploitable crash
      due to integer underflow when using a large JavaScript RegExp
      expression. We would also like to thank Mark for contributing the fix
      for this problem. (no CVE yet)

    * 

      MFSA 2011-38: Mozilla developer Boris Zbarsky reported that a frame
      named &quot;location&quot; could shadow the window.location object unless a
      script in a page grabbed a reference to the true object before the
      frame was created. Because some plugins use the value of
      window.location to determine the page origin this could fool the
      plugin into granting the plugin content access to another site or the
      local file system in violation of the Same Origin Policy. This flaw
      allows circumvention of the fix added for MFSA 2010-10.
      (CVE-2011-2999)

    * 

      MFSA 2011-39: Ian Graham of Citrix Online reported that when multiple
      Location headers were present in a redirect response Mozilla behavior
      differed from other browsers: Mozilla would use the second Location
      header while Chrome and Internet Explorer would use the first. Two
      copies of this header with different values could be a symptom of a
      CRLF injection attack against a vulnerable server. Most commonly it
      is the Location header itself that is vulnerable to the response
      splitting and therefore the copy preferred by Mozilla is more likely
      to be the malicious one. It is possible, however, that the first copy

      vulnerability.

      The Mozilla browser engine has been changed to treat two copies of
      this header with different values as an error condition. The same has
      been done with the headers Content-Length and Content-Disposition.

      MFSA 2011-40: Mariusz Mlynski reported that if you could convince a
      user to hold down the Enter key--as part of a game or test,
      perhaps--a malicious page could pop up a download dialog where the
      held key would then activate the default Open action. For some file
      types this would be merely annoying (the equivalent of a pop-up) but
      other file types have powerful scripting capabilities. And this would
      provide an avenue for an attacker to exploit a vulnerability in
      applications not normally exposed to potentially hostile internet
      content.

      Holding enter allows arbitrary code execution due to Download Manager
      (CVE-2011-2372)

  <summary>Recommended update for augeas  </summary>
  <description>
This update provides an update of augeas to version 0.8.1. Augeas is a 
library for programmatically editing configuration files. Augeas parses 
configuration files into a tree structure, which it exposes through its 
public API. Changes made through the API are written back to the initially 
read files.

The transformation works very hard to preserve comments and formatting 
details. It is controlled by &quot;lens&quot; definitions that describe the file 
format and the transformation into a tree.

This release contains a number of bugfixes, most importantly one that 
addresses an issue with mutlithreaded programs that use multiple &apos;struct 
augeas&apos; instances, like libvirt (BZ 690286). Path expressions support 
regexp matches and unions of nodesets. Augeas can now be run under non-C 
locales (this mostly affects users of the Perl and Java bindings). The API 
now contains several functions (aug_error and friends) to do more 
fine-grained error reporting. Bugfixes to many lenses, and the addition of 
lenses for /etc/ethers, /etc/postfix/access, and Wine registry-

  <summary>Security update for Xorg  </summary>
  <description>
This update for xorg-x11-server and xorg-x11-libs brings improved 
compatibility fixes and enhancements for X.org. The main feature is support 
for Multi monitor configurations with independent heads, which used to be 
supported with SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 (VGA Arbitration Support).

During update to Service Pack 1, the support for AppGroup Extension was 
removed from the X11 Server. This update fixes this regression and adds 
back the support (bnc#709943).

Additionally this update fixes bugs in the AppGroup Extensions, which 
resulted in Xserver crashes (bnc #716355).

It also fixes an issue with changing the mouse mode to absolute 
(bnc#704467).

It also fixes an issue with button release on non-core pointing devices 
(bnc#698281).

In addition to that, multiple missing or incorrect bounds checking flaws 
were fixed in in GLX (CVE-2010-4818) and in the X Render Extension 
(CVE-2010-4819) were fixed, which could be used to crash the X server.

A regression in handling TWM was fixed as well (bnc#709987).

  <summary>Security update for Apache2  </summary>
  <description>
This update brings Apache to version 2.2.12.

The main reason is the enablement of the Server Name Indication (SNI) that 
allows several SSL-enabled domains on one IP address (FATE#311973). See the 
SSLStrictSNIVHostCheck directive as documented in 
/usr/share/apache2/manual/mod/mod_ssl.html.en

Also the patch for the ByteRange remote denial of service attack 
(CVE-2011-3192) was refined and the configuration options used by upstream 
were added.

Introduce new config option: Allow MaxRanges
Number of ranges requested, if exceeded, the complete content is served.
default: 200
0|unlimited: unlimited
none: Range headers are ignored.
This option is a backport from 2.2.21.

Also fixed were

    * CVE-2011-3348: Denial of service in proxy_ajp when using a undefined
      method.
    * CVE-2011-3368: Exposure of internal servers via reverse proxy methods
      with mod_proxy enabled and incorrect Rewrite or Proxy Rules.

This update also includes a newer apache2-vhost-ssl.template, which 
disables SSLv2, and allows SSLv3 and strong ciphers only. Please note that 
existing vhosts will not be converted.

  <summary>Recommended update for spamassassin  </summary>
  <description>
This update provides spamassassin 3.3.1 with many improvements and fixes:

    * IPv6 support was substantially improved
    * many improvements to the DKIM plugin (understands author domain
      signatures, supports multiple signatures, ADSP support with
      overrides)
    * added a configuration option &apos;time_limit&apos;, defaulting to 300 seconds
      or whatever the caller (like spamd) provides; attempting to
      gracefully terminate the checking when a time limit is reached,
      reporting the score and test hits that were collected so far, along
      with an added hit on a rule TIME_LIMIT_EXCEEDED;
    * configurable network mask length for the AWL plugin
    * added IPv6 support for trusted_networks, internal_networks,
      msa_networks, whitelist_from_rcvd, and other stuff that uses NetSet
      and the Received header field parser, using NetAddr::IP;
    * allowed usage of a remote dccifd host through an INET or INET6
      socket;
    * added IPv6 support to AWL plugin and its utility modules; a network
      mask length is now configurable and defaults to /48, which controls
      what data is stored in an AWL database;
    * IP_PRIVATE now includes ipv6 variants of private address space as
      well as the ipv6-mapped ipv4 addresses.
    * NetSet now understands that ::ffff:192.168.1.2 and 192.168.1.2 are
      the same address;
    * IPv6 addresses are now properly read from Received header fields;
    * when reading Received header fields, the &quot;IPv6:&quot; prefix is stripped
      from IPv6 addresses, and &quot;::ffff:&quot; is removed from IPv6-mapped IPv4
      addresses (so strings can match them as simply IPv4 addresses);
    * ::1/128 is always included in the trusted_networks/internal_networks
      set similar to 127.0.0.0/8;

  <description>
The implementation of the blowfish based password hashing method had a bug 
affecting passwords that contain 8bit characters (e.g. umlauts). Affected 
passwords are potentially faster to crack via brute force methods 
(CVE-2011-2483).

SUSE&apos;s crypt() implementation supports the blowfish password hashing 
function (id $2a) and system logins by default also use this method. This 
update eliminates the bug in the $2a implementation. After installing the 
update existing $2a hashes therefore no longer match hashes generated with 
the new, correct implementation if the password contains 8bit characters. 
For system logins via PAM the pam_unix2 module activates a compat mode and 
keeps processing existing $2a hashes with the old algorithm. This ensures 
no user gets locked out. New passwords hashes are created with the id &quot;$2y&quot; 
to unambiguously identify them as generated with the correct 
implementation.

Note: To actually migrate hashes to the new algorithm all users are advised 
to change passwords after the update.

Services that do not use PAM but do use crypt() to store passwords using 
the blowfish hash do not have such a compat mode. That means users with 
8bit passwords that use such services will not be able to log in anymore 
after the update. As workaround administrators may edit the service&apos;s 
password database and change stored hashes from $2a to $2x. This will 
result in crypt() using the old algorithm. Users should be required to 
change their passwords to make sure they are migrated to the correct 
algorithm.

FAQ:

Q: I only use ASCII characters in passwords, am I a affected in any way?
A: No.

Q: What&apos;s the meaning of the ids before and after the update?
A: Before the update:
$2a -&gt; buggy algorithm

After the update:
$2x -&gt; buggy algorithm
$2a -&gt; correct algorithm
$2y -&gt; correct algorithm

System logins using PAM have a compat mode enabled by default:
$2x -&gt; buggy algorithm
$2a -&gt; buggy algorithm
$2y -&gt; correct algorithm

Q: How do I require users to change their password on next login?
A: Run the following command as root for each user:
chage -d 0

Q: I run an application that has $2a hashes in it&apos;s password database. Some 
users complain that they can not log in anymore.
A: Edit the password database and change the &quot;$2a&quot; prefix of the affected 
users&apos; hashes to &quot;$2x&quot;. They will be able to log in again but should change 
their password ASAP.

Q: How do I turn off the compat mode for system logins?
A: Set BLOWFISH_2a2x=no in /etc/default/passwd

This update provides Mozilla Firefox 10, which provides many fixes, 
security and feature enhancements.

The following security issues have been fixed in this update:

    * 

      Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory safety bugs in
      the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products.
      Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
      circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at least some
      of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. (MFSA 2012-01
      &lt;http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2012/mfsa2012-01.html&gt; , 
      CVE-2012-0442

      CVE-2012-0443
      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-0443&gt; )

    * 

      Alex Dvorov reported that an attacker could replace a sub-frame in
      another domain&apos;s document by using the name attribute of the
      sub-frame as a form submission target. This can potentially allow for
      phishing attacks against users and violates the HTML5 frame
      navigation policy. (MFSA 2012-03
      &lt;http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2012/mfsa2012-03.html&gt; , 
      CVE-2012-0445
      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-0445&gt; )

    * 

      Security researcher regenrecht reported via TippingPoint&apos;s Zero Day
      Initiative that removed child nodes of nsDOMAttribute can be accessed
      under certain circumstances because of a premature notification of
      AttributeChildRemoved. This use-after-free of the child nodes could
      possibly allow for for remote code execution. (MFSA 2012-04
      &lt;http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2012/mfsa2012-04.html&gt; , 
      CVE-2011-3659
      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3659&gt; )

    * 

      Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reported that frame scripts
      bypass XPConnect security checks when calling untrusted objects. This
      allows for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks through web pages and
      Firefox extensions. The fix enables the Script Security Manager (SSM)
      to force security checks on all frame scripts. (MFSA 2012-05
      &lt;http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2012/mfsa2012-05.html&gt; , 
      CVE-2012-0446

    * 

      Mozilla developer Tim Abraldes reported that when encoding images as
      image/vnd.microsoft.icon the resulting data was always a fixed size,
      with uninitialized memory appended as padding beyond the size of the
      actual image. This is the result of mImageBufferSize in the encoder
      being initialized with a value different than the size of the source
      image. There is the possibility of sensitive data from uninitialized
      memory being appended to a PNG image when converted fron an ICO
      format image. This sensitive data may then be disclosed in the
      resulting image. ((MFSA 2012-06)

      [CVE-2012-0447
      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-0447&gt; )

    * 

      Security researcher regenrecht reported via TippingPoint&apos;s Zero Day
      Initiative the possibility of memory corruption during the decoding
      of Ogg Vorbis files. This can cause a crash during decoding and has
      the potential for remote code execution. (MFSA 2012-07

      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-0444&gt; )

    * 

      Security researchers Nicolas Gregoire and Aki Helin independently
      reported that when processing a malformed embedded XSLT stylesheet,
      Firefox can crash due to a memory corruption. While there is no
      evidence that this is directly exploitable, there is a possibility of
      remote code execution. (MFSA 2012-08

    * 

      magicant starmen reported that if a user chooses to export their
      Firefox Sync key the &quot;Firefox Recovery Key.html&quot; file is saved with
      incorrect permissions, making the file contents potentially readable
      by other users on Linux and OS X systems. (MFSA 2012-09

  <summary>Security update for Mozilla XULrunner  </summary>
  <description>
Mozilla XULrunner was updated to 1.9.2.26 security update, fixing security 
issues and bugs. The following security bugs have been fixed:

    * 

      MFSA 2012-01: Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory
      safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other
      Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory
      corruption under certain circumstances, and we presume that with
      enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
      arbitrary code.

      In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
      Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but
      are potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those
      products. References

    * 

      CVE-2012-0442: Jesse Ruderman and Bob Clary reported memory safety
      problems that were fixed in both Firefox 10 and Firefox 3.6.26.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-02/CVE-2011-3670: For historical reasons Firefox has been
      generous in its interpretation of web addresses containing square
      brackets around the host. If this host was not a valid IPv6 literal
      address, Firefox attempted to interpret the host as a regular domain
      name. Gregory Fleischer reported that requests made using IPv6 syntax
      using XMLHttpRequest objects through a proxy may generate errors
      depending on proxy configuration for IPv6. The resulting error
      messages from the proxy may disclose sensitive data because
      Same-Origin Policy (SOP) will allow the XMLHttpRequest object to read
      these error messages, allowing user privacy to be eroded. Firefox now
      enforces RFC 3986 IPv6 literal syntax and that may break links
      written using the non-standard Firefox-only forms that were
      previously accepted.

      This was fixed previously for Firefox 7.0, Thunderbird 7.0, and
      SeaMonkey 2.4 but only fixed in Firefox 3.6.26 and Thunderbird 3.1.18
      during 2012.

      corruption during the decoding of Ogg Vorbis files. This can cause a

      embedded XSLT stylesheet, Firefox can crash due to a memory

In addition, a version update to 1.0.114 has been performed that provides 
the following fixes:

    * robustness fixes for banning/recovery lock
    * fixes for per-ip-routing
    * always migrate a record in a ctdb call
    * Incorrect use of dup2() could cause ctdb to spin eating 100% cpu.
    * Massive eventscript updates. (bz58828)
    * Nice the daemon instead of using realtime scheduler, also use
      mlockall() to reduce the risk of blockign due to paging.
    * Sync the tdb library with upstream, and use the new
      TDB_DISALLOW_NESTING flag.
    * Add new command &quot;ctdb dumpdbbackup&quot;
    * Use the new wbinfo --ping-dc instead of -p in the eventscript for
      samba the check if winbindd is ok.
    * fix a double-free that can happen when there are multiple packets
      queued and the connection is destroyed before all packets are
      processed.
    * Dont do a full recovery when there is a mismatch detected for ip
      addresses, just do a less disruptive ip-reallocation
    * When starting ctdbd, wait until all initial recoveries have finished
      before we issue the &quot;startup&quot; event.

  <description>
This update of apache2 and libapr1 fixes regressions and several security 
problems.

    * CVE-2012-0031: Fixed a scoreboard corruption (shared mem segment) by
      child causes crash of privileged parent (invalid free()) during
      shutdown.
    * CVE-2012-0053: Fixed an issue in error responses that could expose
      &quot;httpOnly&quot; cookies when no custom ErrorDocument is specified for
      status code 400&quot;.
    * CVE-2007-6750: The &quot;mod_reqtimeout&quot; module was backported from Apache
      2.2.21 to help mitigate the &quot;Slowloris&quot; Denial of Service attack.

You need to enable the &quot;mod_reqtimeout&quot; module in your existing apache 
configuration to make it effective, e.g. in the APACHE_MODULES line in 
/etc/sysconfig/apache2.
For more detailed information, check also the README file.

Also the following bugs have been fixed:

    * Fixed init script action &quot;check-reload&quot; to avoid potential crashes.
      bnc#728876
    * An overlapping memcpy() was replaced by memmove() to make this work
      with newer glibcs. bnc#738067 bnc#741874
    * libapr1: reset errno to zero to not return previous value despite
      good status of new operation. bnc#739783

  <description>
lxml is a Pythonic binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries. It 
follows the ElementTree API as much as possible, building it on top of the 
native libxml2 tree. It also extends this API to expose libxml2 and libxslt 
specific functionality, such as XPath, Relax NG, XML Schema, XSLT, and 
c14n.

  <summary>Security update for Mozilla Firefox  </summary>
  <description>
Mozilla Firefox was updated to 10.0.3 ESR to fix various bugs and security 
issues.

The following security issues have been fixed:

    * 

      MFSA 2012-19: Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory
      safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other
      Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory
      corruption under certain circumstances, and we presume that with
      enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
      arbitrary code.

      In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
      Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but
      are potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those
      products.

      References:

      Bob Clary reported two bugs that causes crashes that affected Firefox
      3.6, Firefox ESR, and Firefox 10. CVE-2012-0461

      Christian Holler, Jesse Ruderman, Nils, Michael Bebenita, Dindog, and
      David Anderson reported memory safety problems and crashes that
      affect Firefox ESR and Firefox 10. CVE-2012-0462

      Jeff Walden reported a memory safety problem in the array.join
      function. This bug was independently reported by Vincenzo Iozzo via
      TippingPoint&apos;s Zero Day Initiative Pwn2Own contest. CVE-2012-0464

      Masayuki Nakano reported a memory safety problem that affected Mobile
      Firefox

    * 

      CVE-2012-0463

    * 

      MFSA 2012-18 / CVE-2012-0460: Mozilla developer Matt Brubeck reported
      that window.fullScreen is writeable by untrusted content now that the
      DOM fullscreen API is enabled. Because window.fullScreen does not
      include mozRequestFullscreen&apos;s security protections, it could be used
      for UI spoofing. This code change makes window.fullScreen read only
      by untrusted content, forcing the use of the DOM fullscreen API in
      normal usage.

      Firefox 3.6 and Thunderbird 3.1 are not affected by this
      vulnerability.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-17 / CVE-2012-0459: Mozilla community member Daniel Glazman
      of Disruptive Innovations reported a crash when accessing a
      keyframe&apos;s cssText after dynamic modification. This crash may be
      potentially exploitable.

      Firefox 3.6 and Thunderbird 3.1 are not affected by this
      vulnerability.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-16 / CVE-2012-0458: Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski
      reported that an attacker able to convince a potential victim to set
      a new home page by dragging a link to the &quot;home&quot; button can set that
      user&apos;s home page to a javascript: URL. Once this is done the
      attacker&apos;s page can cause repeated crashes of the browser, eventually
      getting the script URL loaded in the privileged about:sessionrestore
      context.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-15 / CVE-2012-0451: Security Researcher Mike Brooks of
      Sitewatch reported that if multiple Content Security Policy (CSP)
      headers are present on a page, they have an additive effect page
      policy. Using carriage return line feed (CRLF) injection, a new CSP
      rule can be introduced which allows for cross-site scripting (XSS) on
      sites with a separate header injection vulnerability.

      Firefox 3.6 and Thunderbird 3.1 are not affected by this
      vulnerability.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-14 / CVE-2012-0457 / CVE-2012-0456: Security researcher
      Atte Kettunen from OUSPG found two issues with Firefox&apos;s handling of
      SVG using the Address Sanitizer tool. The first issue, critically
      rated, is a use-after-free in SVG animation that could potentially
      lead to arbitrary code execution. The second issue is rated moderate
      and is an out of bounds read in SVG Filters. This could potentially
      incorporate data from the user&apos;s memory, making it accessible to the
      page content.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-13 / CVE-2012-0455: Firefox prevents the dropping of
      javascript: links onto a frame to prevent malicious sites from
      tricking users into performing a cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
      on themselves. Security researcher Soroush Dalili reported a way to
      bypass this protection.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-12 / CVE-2012-0454: Security researchers Blair Strang and
      Scott Bell of Security Assessment found that when a parent window
      spawns and closes a child window that uses the file open dialog, a
      crash can be induced in shlwapi.dll on 32-bit Windows 7 systems. This
      crash may be potentially exploitable.

      Firefox 3.6 and Thunderbird 3.1 are not affected by this
      vulnerability.

  <description>
This update for ghostscript-library fixes a regression in Ghostscript 8.62 
where it did no longer use fonts specified via FONTPATH=/path/to/font when 
they are not considered to be resource fonts.

In addition, the following low impact security fixes are included:

    * CVE-2009-3743: Off-by-one error in the TrueType bytecode interpreter
      in Ghostscript before 8.71 allowed remote attackers to cause a denial
      of service (heap memory corruption) via a malformed TrueType font in
      a document.
    * CVE-2010-4054: The gs_type2_interpret function in Ghostscript allowed
      remote attackers to cause a denial of service (incorrect pointer
      dereference and application crash) via crafted font data in a
      compressed data stream.

  <summary>Security update for Mozilla Firefox  </summary>
  <description>
MozillaFirefox was updated to the 10.0.4 ESR release to fix various bugs 
and security issues.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-20: Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory
      safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other
      Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory
      corruption under certain circumstances, and we presume that with
      enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
      arbitrary code.

      In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
      Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but
      are potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those
      products.

      Christian Holler a reported memory safety and security problem
      affecting Firefox 11. (CVE-2012-0468)

      Bob Clary, Christian Holler, Brian Hackett, Bobby Holley, Gary Kwong,
      Hilary Hall, Honza Bambas, Jesse Ruderman, Julian Seward, and Olli
      Pettay reported memory safety problems and crashes that affect
      Firefox ESR and Firefox 11. (CVE-2012-0467)

    * 

      MFSA 2012-22 / CVE-2012-0469: Using the Address Sanitizer tool,
      security researcher Aki Helin from OUSPG found that IDBKeyRange of
      indexedDB remains in the XPConnect hashtable instead of being
      unlinked before being destroyed. When it is destroyed, this causes a
      use-after-free, which is potentially exploitable.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-23 / CVE-2012-0470: Using the Address Sanitizer tool,
      security researcher Atte Kettunen from OUSPG found a heap corruption
      in gfxImageSurface which allows for invalid frees and possible remote
      code execution. This happens due to float error, resulting from
      graphics values being passed through different number systems.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-24 / CVE-2012-0471: Anne van Kesteren of Opera Software
      found a multi-octet encoding issue where certain octets will destroy
      the following octets in the processing of some multibyte character
      sets. This can leave users vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS)
      attacks on maliciously crafted web pages.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-25 / CVE-2012-0472: Security research firm iDefense
      reported that researcher wushi of team509 discovered a memory
      corruption on Windows Vista and Windows 7 systems with hardware
      acceleration disabled or using incompatible video drivers. This is
      created by using cairo-dwrite to attempt to render fonts on an
      unsupported code path. This corruption causes a potentially
      exploitable crash on affected systems.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-26 / CVE-2012-0473: Mozilla community member Matias
      Juntunen discovered an error in WebGLBuffer where
      FindMaxElementInSubArray receives wrong template arguments from
      FindMaxUshortElement. This bug causes maximum index to be computed
      incorrectly within WebGL.drawElements, allowing the reading of
      illegal video memory.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-27 / CVE-2012-0474: Security researchers Jordi Chancel and
      Eddy Bordi reported that they could short-circuit page loads to show
      the address of a different site than what is loaded in the window in
      the addressbar. Security researcher Chris McGowen independently
      reported the same flaw, and further demonstrated that this could lead
      to loading scripts from the attacker&apos;s site, leaving users vulnerable
      to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-28 / CVE-2012-0475: Security researcher Simone Fabiano
      reported that if a cross-site XHR or WebSocket is opened on a web
      server on a non-standard port for web traffic while using an IPv6
      address, the browser will send an ambiguous origin headers if the
      IPv6 address contains at least 2 consecutive 16-bit fields of zeroes.
      If there is an origin access control list that uses IPv6 literals,
      this issue could be used to bypass these access controls on the
      server.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-29 / CVE-2012-0477: Security researcher Masato Kinugawa
      found that during the decoding of ISO-2022-KR and ISO-2022-CN
      character sets, characters near 1024 bytes are treated incorrectly,
      either doubling or deleting bytes. On certain pages it might be
      possible for an attacker to pad the output of the page such that
      these errors fall in the right place to affect the structure of the
      page, allowing for cross-site script (XSS) injection.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-30 / CVE-2012-0478: Mozilla community member Ms2ger found
      an image rendering issue with WebGL when texImage2D uses use
      JSVAL_TO_OBJECT on arbitrary objects. This can lead to a crash on a
      maliciously crafted web page. While there is no evidence that this is
      directly exploitable, there is a possibility of remote code
      execution.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-31 / CVE-2011-3062: Mateusz Jurczyk of the Google Security
      Team discovered an off-by-one error in the OpenType Sanitizer using
      the Address Sanitizer tool. This can lead to an out-of-bounds read
      and execution of an uninitialized function pointer during parsing and
      possible remote code execution.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-32 / CVE-2011-1187: Security researcher Daniel Divricean
      reported that a defect in the error handling of javascript errors can
      leak the file names and location of javascript files on a server,
      leading to inadvertent information disclosure and a vector for
      further attacks.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-33 / CVE-2012-0479: Security researcher Jeroen van der Gun
      reported that if RSS or Atom XML invalid content is loaded over
      HTTPS, the addressbar updates to display the new location of the
      loaded resource, including SSL indicators, while the main window
      still displays the previously loaded content. This allows for
      phishing attacks where a malicious page can spoof the identify of
      another seemingly secure site.

This update of openssl fixes an integer conversation issue which could 
cause a heap-based memory corruption (CVE-2012-2110
&lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-2110&gt; ).

Additionally, a check for negative buffer length values was added (
CVE-2012-2131 &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-2131&gt; 
) and the stack made non-executable by marking the enhanced Intel SSSE3 
assembler code as not needing executable stack.

  <description>
Multiple security vulnerabilities were reported in RPM which could be 
exploited via specially crafted RPM files to cause a denial of service

Additionally, a non-security issue was fixed that could cause a division by 
zero in cycles calculation under rare circumstances.

This update to python 2.6.8 fixes the following bugs, among others:

    * XMLRPC Server DoS (CVE-2012-0845, bnc#747125)
    * hash randomization issues (CVE-2012-1150, bnc#751718)
    * insecure creation of .pypirc (CVE-2011-4944, bnc#754447)
    * SimpleHTTPServer XSS (CVE-2011-1015, bnc#752375)
    * functions can accept unicode kwargs (bnc#744287)
    * python MainThread lacks ident (bnc#754547)
    * TypeError: waitpid() takes no keyword arguments (bnc#751714)
    * Source code exposure in CGIHTTPServer module (CVE-2011-1015,
      bnc#674646)
    * Insecure redirect processing in urllib2 (CVE-2011-1521, bnc#682554)

The hash randomization fix is by default disabled to keep compatibility 
with existing python code when it extracts hashes.

To enable the hash seed randomization you can use: - pass -R to the python 
interpreter commandline. - set the environment variable 
PYTHONHASHSEED=random to enable it for programs. You can also set this 
environment variable to a fixed hash seed by specifying a integer value 
between 0 and MAX_UINT.

In generally enabling this is only needed when malicious third parties can 
inject values into your hash tables.

The update to 2.6.8 also provides many compatibility fixes with OpenStack.

  <summary>Security update for Xen  </summary>
  <description>
Three security issues were found in XEN.

Two security issues are fixed by this update:

    * 

      CVE-2012-0217: Due to incorrect fault handling in the XEN hypervisor
      it was possible for a XEN guest domain administrator to execute code
      in the XEN host environment.

    * 

      CVE-2012-0218: Also a guest user could crash the guest XEN kernel due
      to a protection fault bounce.

The third fix is changing the Xen behaviour on certain hardware:

    * 

      CVE-2012-2934: The issue is a denial of service issue on older
      pre-SVM AMD CPUs (AMD Erratum 121).

      AMD Erratum #121 is described in &quot;Revision Guide for AMD Athlon 64
      and AMD Opteron Processors&quot;:
      http://support.amd.com/us/Processor_TechDocs/25759.pdf
      &lt;http://support.amd.com/us/Processor_TechDocs/25759.pdf&gt;

      The following 130nm and 90nm (DDR1-only) AMD processors are subject
      to this erratum:

          o 

            First-generation AMD-Opteron(tm) single and dual core
            processors in either 939 or 940 packages:

                + AMD Opteron(tm) 100-Series Processors
                + AMD Opteron(tm) 200-Series Processors
                + AMD Opteron(tm) 800-Series Processors
                + AMD Athlon(tm) processors in either 754, 939 or 940
                  packages
                + AMD Sempron(tm) processor in either 754 or 939 packages
                + AMD Turion(tm) Mobile Technology in 754 package

      This issue does not effect Intel processors.

      The impact of this flaw is that a malicious PV guest user can halt
      the host system.

      As this is a hardware flaw, it is not fixable except by upgrading
      your hardware to a newer revision, or not allowing untrusted 64bit
      guestsystems.

      The patch changes the behaviour of the host system booting, which
      makes it unable to create guest machines until a specific boot option
      is set.

      There is a new XEN boot option &quot;allow_unsafe&quot; for GRUB which allows
      the host to start guests again.

      This is added to /boot/grub/menu.lst in the line looking like this:

      kernel /boot/xen.gz .... allow_unsafe

      Note: .... in this example represents the existing boot options for
      the host.

  <summary>Security update for Mozilla Firefox  </summary>
  <description>
MozillaFirefox has been updated to 10.0.5ESR fixing various bugs and 
security issues.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-34
      Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory safety bugs in
      the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products.
      Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
      circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at least some
      of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

      In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
      Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but
      are potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those
      products. References

      Jesse Ruderman, Igor Bukanov, Bill McCloskey, Christian Holler,
      Andrew McCreight, and Brian Bondy reported memory safety problems and
      crashes that affect Firefox 12.(CVE-2012-1938)

      Christian Holler reported a memory safety problem that affects
      Firefox ESR. (CVE-2012-1939)

      Igor Bukanov, Olli Pettay, Boris Zbarsky, and Jesse Ruderman reported
      memory safety problems and crashes that affect Firefox ESR and
      Firefox 13. (CVE-2012-1937)

      Ken Russell of Google reported a bug in NVIDIA graphics drivers that
      they needed to work around in the Chromium WebGL implementation.
      Mozilla has done the same in Firefox 13 and ESR 10.0.5.
      (CVE-2011-3101)

    * 

      MFSA 2012-35
      Security researcher James Forshaw of Context Information Security
      found two issues with the Mozilla updater and the Mozilla updater
      service introduced in Firefox 12 for Windows. The first issue allows
      Mozilla&apos;s updater to load a local DLL file in a privileged context.
      The updater can be called by the Updater Service or independently on
      systems that do not use the service. The second of these issues
      allows for the updater service to load an arbitrary local DLL file,
      which can then be run with the same system privileges used by the
      service. Both of these issues require local file system access to be
      exploitable.

      Possible Arbitrary Code Execution by Update Service (CVE-2012-1942)
      Updater.exe loads wsock32.dll from application directory
      (CVE-2012-1943)

    * 

      MFSA 2012-36
      Security researcher Adam Barth found that inline event handlers, such
      as onclick, were no longer blocked by Content Security Policy&apos;s (CSP)
      inline-script blocking feature. Web applications relying on this
      feature of CSP to protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) were not
      fully protected. (CVE-2012-1944)

    * 

      MFSA 2012-37
      Security researcher Paul Stone reported an attack where an HTML page
      hosted on a Windows share and then loaded could then load Windows
      shortcut files (.lnk) in the same share. These shortcut files could
      then link to arbitrary locations on the local file system of the
      individual loading the HTML page. That page could show the contents
      of these linked files or directories from the local file system in an
      iframe, causing information disclosure.

      This issue could potentially affect Linux machines with samba shares
      enabled. (CVE-2012-1945)

    * 

      MFSA 2012-38
      Security researcher Arthur Gerkis used the Address Sanitizer tool to
      find a use-after-free while replacing/inserting a node in a document.
      This use-after-free could possibly allow for remote code execution.
      (CVE-2012-1946)

    * 

      MFSA 2012-39
      Security researcher Kaspar Brand found a flaw in how the Network
      Security Services (NSS) ASN.1 decoder handles zero length items.
      Effects of this issue depend on the field. One known symptom is an
      unexploitable crash in handling OCSP responses. NSS also mishandles
      zero-length basic constraints, assuming default values for some types
      that should be rejected as malformed. These issues have been
      addressed in NSS 3.13.4, which is now being used by Mozilla.
      (CVE-2012-0441)

    * 

      MFSA 2012-40
      Security researcher Abhishek Arya of Google used the Address
      Sanitizer tool to uncover several issues: two heap buffer overflow
      bugs and a use-after-free problem. The first heap buffer overflow was
      found in conversion from unicode to native character sets when the
      function fails. The use-after-free occurs in nsFrameList when working
      with column layout with absolute positioning in a container that
      changes size. The second buffer overflow occurs in nsHTMLReflowState
      when a window is resized on a page with nested columns and a
      combination of absolute and relative positioning. All three of these
      issues are potentially exploitable.

      Heap-buffer-overflow in utf16_to_isolatin1 (CVE-2012-1947)
      Heap-use-after-free in nsFrameList::FirstChild (CVE-2012-1940)

      Heap-buffer-overflow in nsHTMLReflowState::CalculateHypotheticalBox,
      with nested multi-column, relative position, and absolute position
      (CVE-2012-1941)

  <summary>Feature update for pciutils  </summary>
  <description>
This update provides pciutils 3.1.7, which improves correctness and 
completeness of information reporting for VF devices.

    * All extended capabilities have their version displayed (-vv or more).
    * When scanning extended capabilities, properly mask the lowest 2 bits,
      which are currently reserved. This avoids unaligned access errors on
      broken hardware (see tests/broken-ecaps).
    * Large bar sizes are displayed in human-readable format (with units).
    * The SR-IOV capability decoder now prints the VF BAR&apos;s.
    * The VPD parser now reports unknown and vendor-defined items properly.
      It also stops on any item in unknown format, avoiding long output on
      bogus VPD data
    * The Power Management capability now includes the soft reset bit.
    * Decoding of the Advanced Features capability has been added.
    * The procfs back-end is able to cope with /proc/bus/pci containing
      names with domains, which occur on sparc64 and possibly other
      architectures due to a kernel bug.
    * The MSI and MSI-X capabilities are printed in a prettier way.
    * When a BAR is reported by the OS, but not by the device (i.e., it is
      marked as [virtual] in lspci), the [disabled] flag is suppressed,
      because it does not make sense in such cases.
    * When a device has the VPD (Vital Product Data) capability and the VPD
      data are supplied by the OS, they are decoded and printed in the
      verbose mode. This currently works only on Linux with the sysfs
      back-end.
    * The setpci utility is now able to address registers stored in PCI
      capabilities (actually it allows a more general form of relative
      addressing).
    * The library has gained functions for working with PCI capabilities.
    * Fixed printing of the AER capability.

    * On x86, the function pthread_cond_timedwait interpreted the timeout

      This issue does not effect Intel processors.

      The impact of this flaw is that a malicious PV guest user can halt
      the host system.

      As this is a hardware flaw, it is not fixable except by upgrading
      your hardware to a newer revision, or not allowing untrusted 64bit
      guestsystems.

      The patch changes the behaviour of the host system booting, which
      makes it unable to create guest machines until a specific boot option
      is set.

      There is a new XEN boot option &quot;allow_unsafe&quot; for GRUB which allows
      the host to start guests again.

      This is added to /boot/grub/menu.lst in the line looking like this:

      kernel /boot/xen.gz .... allow_unsafe

      or add this option to the XEN_APPEND line /etc/sysconfig/bootloader,
      like e.g.:

      XEN_APPEND=&quot;allow_unsafe&quot;

      Note: .... in the first example represents the existing boot options
      for the host.

  <description>
This update for Kiwi provides the following fixes:

    * make sure kernelCheck() initializes list of kernels if empty (bnc
      #752259)
    * fixed entry for hv_netvsc.ko driver
    * add new kernel module paths for Microsoft HyperV (hv) modules
    * fixed xen check which makes sure to include the _non_ splash version
      of the initrd into the image because the xen loader doesn&apos;t like the
      splash info at the end of the cpio archive (bnc #736491)
    * fixed initrd module list for ec2 format code
    * netboot: fixed setup of root device for local boot
    * fixed mkinitrd call in ec2 format code:
    * don&apos;t use -A also make sure the exit code of mkinitrd is evaluated
    * make sure all required filesystem modules are added to
      /etc/sysconfig/kernel before calling mkinitrd
    * because the input stream from XML is utf-8 encoded it&apos;s required to
      set binmode correctly to utf-8 too when writing the data out. This is
      at least required for the profile file inside the initrd because it
      contains data from the XML like the oem boot title
    * follow up and improved fix for basePackBootIncludes to pack only
      items listed in the rpm package filelist but don&apos;t recursively look
      them up in the filesystem when tar&apos;ing them up (bnc #743159)
    * added staging/hv drivers to SLE11 boot image descriptions. Beginning
      with SLE11-SP2 the drivers are part of the standard kernel and thus
      they should be preserved (bnc #747898)
    * with reference to (bnc #747898) a new function called
      suseStripModules() has been added. The function searches for update
      modules and removes the old version which might be provided by the
      standard kernel to prevent a load clash
    * make sure /etc/modprobe.d is preserved (bnc #747898)
    * added virtio drivers for sle10 boot image descriptions (bnc #747346)
    * fixed importFile function to export only prefixed version of the
      variable if there is a prefix and not both (bnc #732247)
    * fixed import of dhcp info file (bnc #745548)
    * added rootfs check to ec2 format code
    * fixed updateOtherDeviceFstab() to correctly create missing mount
      points inside the root file system (bnc #754344)
    * fixed creation of sat job list, eliminate duplicate jobs
    * make sure solver failed packages/patterns are evaluated in info
      module
    * make sure solver problems are evaluated in info module
    * removed obsolete test and import of grub binary from initrd
    * the extracted binary is not called so this is dirty code

      Security researcher Amit Klein reported that it was possible to
      reverse engineer the value used to seed Math.random(). Since the
      pseudo-random number generator was only seeded once per browsing
      session, this seed value could be used as a unique token to identify
      and track users across different web sites. (MFSA 2010-33

    * 

      Security researcher Ilja van Sprundel of IOActive reported that the 
      Content-Disposition: attachment HTTP header was ignored when
      `Content-Type: multipart` was also present. This issue could
      potentially lead to XSS problems in sites that allow users to upload
      arbitrary files and specify a content type but rely on 
      Content-Disposition: attachment to prevent the content from being
      displayed inline. (MFSA 2010-32

      Google security researcher Michal Zalewski reported that focus() 
      could be used to change a user&apos;s cursor focus while they are typing,
      potentially directing their keyboard input to an unintended location.
      This behaviour was also present across origins when content from one
      domain was embedded within another via an iframe. A malicious web
      page could use this behaviour to steal keystrokes from a victim while
      they were typing sensitive information such as a password. (MFSA

      Security researcher Martin Barbella reported via TippingPoint&apos;s Zero
      Day Initiative that an XSLT node sorting routine contained an integer
      overflow vulnerability. In cases where one of the nodes to be sorted
      contained a very large text value, the integer used to allocate a
      memory buffer to store its value would overflow, resulting in too
      small a buffer being created. An attacker could use this
      vulnerability to write data past the end of the buffer, causing the
      browser to crash and potentially running arbitrary code on a victim&apos;s
      computer. (MFSA 2010-30

      Security researcher Nils of MWR InfoSecurity reported that the
      routine for setting the text value for certain types of DOM nodes
      contained an integer overflow vulnerability. When a very long string
      was passed to this routine, the integer value used in creating a new
      memory buffer to hold the string would overflow, resulting in too
      small a buffer being allocated. An attacker could use this
      vulnerability to write data past the end of the buffer, causing a
      crash and potentially running arbitrary code on a victim&apos;s computer.

      Microsoft Vulnerability Research reported that two plugin instances
      could interact in a way in which one plugin gets a reference to an
      object owned by a second plugin and continues to hold that reference
      after the second plugin is unloaded and its object is destroyed. In
      these cases, the first plugin would contain a pointer to freed memory
      which, if accessed, could be used by an attacker to execute arbitrary
      code on a victim&apos;s computer. (MFSA 2010-28

      Security researcher Wushi of Team509 reported that the frame
      construction process for certain types of menus could result in a
      menu containing a pointer to a previously freed menu item. During the
      cycle collection process, this freed item could be accessed,
      resulting in the execution of a section of code potentially
      controlled by an attacker. (MFSA 2010-27

      Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability bugs in the
      browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some
      of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption under certain

    * 

      A memory corruption flaw leading to code execution was reported by
      security researcher Nils of MWR InfoSecurity during the 2010 Pwn2Own
      contest sponsored by TippingPoint&apos;s Zero Day Initiative. By moving
      DOM nodes between documents, Nils found a case where the moved node
      incorrectly retained its old scope. If garbage collection could be
      triggered at the right time then Firefox would later use this freed
      object. The exploit only affects Firefox 3.6 and not earlier
      versions. Updated (June 22, 2010): Firefox 3.5, SeaMonkey 2.0, and
      Thunderbird 3.0 based on earlier versions of the browser engine were
      patched just in case there is an alternate way of triggering the
      underlying flaw. (MFSA 2010-25

    * 

      The implementation of initgroups() of the nss_compat module omits all

      The addmntent() function does not escape the newline character
      properly, allowing the user to insert arbitrary newlines to

  <summary>Security update for Mozilla Firefox  </summary>
  <description>
This update brings Mozilla Firefox to the 3.5.11 security release.

It fixes following security issues:

    * 

      Several memory safety bugs in habe been identified in the browser
      engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of
      these bugs show evidence of memory corruption under certain
      circumstances, and it is presumed that with enough effort at least
      some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
      ((http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2010/mfsa2010-34.html)[MFSA
      2010-34],
      (http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-1211)[CVE-2010-1211])

    * 

      An error in the DOM attribute cloning routine has been reported,
      where under certain circumstances an event attribute node can be
      deleted while another object still contains a reference to it. This
      reference could subsequently be accessed, potentially causing the
      execution of attacker controlled memory.
      ((http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2010/mfsa2010-35.html)[MFSA

    * 

      An error in Mozilla&apos;s implementation of NodeIterator has been
      reported which can be used to create a malicious NodeFilter to detach
      nodes from the DOM tree while it is being traversed. The use of a
      detached and subsequently deleted node could result in the execution
      of attacker controlled memory.

    * 

      An error in the code used to store the names and values of plugin
      parameter elements has been found. A malicious page could embed
      plugin content containing a very large number of parameter elements
      which would cause an overflow in the integer value counting them.
      This integer is later used for allocation of a memory buffer to store
      the plugin parameters. Under such conditions, a buffer that is too
      small would be created and attacker controlled data could be written
      past the end of the buffer, potentially resulting in code execution.

    * 

      An array class used to store CSS values contains an integer overflow
      vulnerability. A 16 bit integer used to allocate the memory for the
      array could overflow, resulting in too small a buffer being created.
      When the array is later populated with CSS values, data could be
      written past the end of the buffer, potentially resulting in the
      execution of attacker controlled memory.

    * 

      An integer overflow vulnerability in the implementation of the XUL 
      &lt;tree&gt; element&apos;s selection attribute has been found. When the size of
      a new selection is sufficiently large, the integer used in
      calculating the length of the selection can overflow, resulting in a
      bogus range being marked as selected. When adjustSelection is then
      called on the bogus range, the range is deleted, leaving dangling
      references to the ranges. These could be used by an attacker to call
      into deleted memory and run arbitrary code on a victim&apos;s computer.

    * 

      A buffer overflow in Mozilla graphics code which consumes image data
      processed by libpng has been reported. A malformed PNG file could be
      created causing libpng to report an incorrect size of the image. When
      the dimensions of such images are underreported, the Mozilla code
      displaying the graphic will allocate a memory buffer to small to
      contain the image data and will wind up writing data past the end of
      the buffer. This could result in the execution of attacker-controlled
      memory.

    * 

      The Web Worker method importScripts can read and parse resources from
      other domains even when the content is not valid JavaScript. This is
      a violation of the same-origin policy and could be used by an
      attacker to steal information from other sites.

    * 

      Two methods for spoofing the content of the location bar have been
      reported. The first method works by opening a new window containing a
      resource that responds with an HTTP 204 (no content) and then using
      the reference to the new window to insert HTML content into the blank
      document. The second location bar spoofing method does not require
      that the resource opened in a new window respond with 204, as long as
      the opener calls window.stop() before the document is loaded. In
      either case a user could be mislead about the correct location of the
      document they are currently viewing.
      ((http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2010/mfsa2010-45.html)[MFSA

      (http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-1206)[CVE-2010-1206])

    * 

      The location bar can be spoofed to look like a secure page even
      though the current document was served via plaintext. The
      vulnerability is triggered by a server by first redirecting a request
      for a plaintext resource to another resource behind a valid SSL/TLS
      certificate. A second request made to the original plaintext resource
      which is responded to not with a redirect, but with JavaScript
      calling history.back() and history.forward() will result in the
      plaintext resource being displayed with a valid SSL/TLS badge in the
      location bar.

    * 

      Data can be read across domains by injecting bogus CSS selectors into
      a target site and then retrieving the data using JavaScript APIs. If
      an attacker can inject opening and closing portions of a CSS selector
      into points A and B of a target page, then the region between the two
      injection points becomes readable to JavaScript through, for example,
      the getComputedStyle() API.

    * 

      Potentially sensitive URL parameters can be leaked across domains
      upon script errors when the script filename and line number is
      included in the error message.

  <description>
This update for ghostscript fixes the following security issues:

    * 

      Specially crafted postscript (.ps) files can cause buffer overflows
      in ghostscript that could potentially be exploited to execute
      arbitrary code. (CVE-2010-1869
      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-1869&gt; ,

      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-4270&gt; )

    * 

      By default, ghostscript reads certain initialization files from the
      current working directory. Local attackers could potentially exploit
      this to have other users execute arbitrary commands by placing such
      files, e.g. in /tmp. (CVE-2010-2055

      DST changes:

          o 

            Africa/Cairo (Egypt) and Asia/Gaza (Palestine) do not use
            daylight saving during the month of Ramadan in order to prevent
            Muslims from fasting one hour longer.

            &lt;http://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/westbank-gaza-end-dst-2010.html&gt;

          o 

            Africa/Casablanca (Marocco) has spent the period from May 2 to
            Aug 8 using daylight saving. Marocco adopted regular daylight
            saving, but the start and end dates vary every year.

            &lt;http://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/morocco-starts-dst-2010.html&gt;

          o 

            America/Argentina/San_Luis (Argentina region) local government
            did not terminate its DST period as planned and instead decided
            to extend its use of the UTC-3 time indefinitely.

            &lt;http://www.worldtimezone.com/dst_news/dst_news_argentina08.html&gt;

    * 

      New zones:

          o America/Bahia_Banderas (Mexican state of Nayarit) has declared
            that it is to follow the UCT-6 time instead of UCT-7, with the
            aim to have the same time as the nearby city of Puerto
            Vallarta.

    * 

      Historical changes:

          o 

            Asia/Taipei information on DST usage listed 1980 as one year
            using DST, which should read 1979 instead according to
            government resources.

          o 

            Europe/Helsinki, before switching to Central European standard
            DST in 1983, trialled DST for two years. However, the database
            omitted to specify that in these trials of 1981 and 1982,
            switches have been made one hour earlier than in 1983.

    * 

      Spelling changes in Micronesia:

          o Pacific/Truk has been renamed to Pacific/Chuuk in 1989.
          o Pacific/Ponape has been renamed to Pacific/Pohnpei in 1984.

The patch utility included a change for being less strict about where to

 <update name="slessp1-MozillaFirefox" edition="3160" arch="noarch" status="not-needed" category="security" pkgmanager="false" restart="false" interactive="false" kind="patch">
  <summary>Security update for Mozilla Firefox  </summary>
  <description>
Mozilla Firefox 3.6 was updated to version 3.6.10, fixing various bugs and 
security issues.

Following security issues were fixed:

    * MFSA 2010-49 / CVE-2010-3169: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
      several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and
      other Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of
      memory corruption under certain circumstances, and we presume that
      with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
      arbitrary code.
    * MFSA 2010-50 / CVE-2010-2765: Security researcher Chris Rohlf of
      Matasano Security reported that the implementation of the HTML
      frameset element contained an integer overflow vulnerability. The
      code responsible for parsing the frameset columns used an 8-byte
      counter for the column numbers, so when a very large number of
      columns was passed in the counter would overflow. When this counter
      was subsequently used to allocate memory for the frameset, the memory
      buffer would be too small, potentially resulting in a heap buffer
      overflow and execution of attacker-controlled memory.
    * MFSA 2010-51 / CVE-2010-2767: Security researcher Sergey Glazunov
      reported a dangling pointer vulnerability in the implementation of
      navigator.plugins in which the navigator object could retain a
      pointer to the plugins array even after it had been destroyed. An
      attacker could potentially use this issue to crash the browser and
      run arbitrary code on a victim&apos;s computer.
    * MFSA 2010-52 / CVE-2010-3131: Security researcher Haifei Li of
      FortiGuard Labs reported that Firefox could be used to load a
      malicious code library that had been planted on a victim&apos;s computer.
      Firefox attempts to load dwmapi.dll upon startup as part of its
      platform detection, so on systems that don&apos;t have this library, such
      as Windows XP, Firefox will subsequently attempt to load the library
      from the current working directory. An attacker could use this
      vulnerability to trick a user into downloading a HTML file and a
      malicious copy of dwmapi.dll into the same directory on their
      computer and opening the HTML file with Firefox, thus causing the
      malicious code to be executed. If the attacker was on the same
      network as the victim, the malicious DLL could also be loaded via a
      UNC path. The attack also requires that Firefox not currently be
      running when it is asked to open the HTML file and accompanying DLL.
      As this is a Windows only problem, it does not affect the Linux
      version. It is listed for completeness only.
    * MFSA 2010-53 / CVE-2010-3166: Security researcher wushi of team509
      reported a heap buffer overflow in code routines responsible for
      transforming text runs. A page could be constructed with a
      bidirectional text run which upon reflow could result in an incorrect
      length being calculated for the run of text. When this value is
      subsequently used to allocate memory for the text too small a buffer
      may be created potentially resulting in a buffer overflow and the
      execution of attacker controlled memory.
    * MFSA 2010-54 / CVE-2010-2760: Security researcher regenrecht reported
      via TippingPoint&apos;s Zero Day Initiative that there was a remaining
      dangling pointer issue leftover from the fix to CVE-2010-2753. Under
      certain circumstances one of the pointers held by a XUL tree
      selection could be freed and then later reused, potentially resulting
      in the execution of attacker-controlled memory.
    * MFSA 2010-55 / CVE-2010-3168: Security researcher regenrecht reported
      via TippingPoint&apos;s Zero Day Initiative that XUL objects could be
      manipulated such that the setting of certain properties on the object
      would trigger the removal of the tree from the DOM and cause certain
      sections of deleted memory to be accessed. In products based on Gecko
      version 1.9.2 (Firefox 3.6, Thunderbird 3.1) and newer this memory
      has been overwritten by a value that will cause an unexploitable
      crash. In products based on Gecko version 1.9.1 (Firefox 3.5,
      Thunderbird 3.0, and SeaMonkey 2.0) and older an attacker could
      potentially use this vulnerability to crash a victim&apos;s browser and
      run arbitrary code on their computer.
    * MFSA 2010-56 / CVE-2010-3167: Security researcher regenrecht reported
      via TippingPoint&apos;s Zero Day Initiative that the implementation of XUL 
      &apos;s content view contains a dangling pointer vulnerability. One of the
      content view&apos;s methods for accessing the internal structure of the
      tree could be manipulated into removing a node prior to accessing it,
      resulting in the accessing of deleted memory. If an attacker can
      control the contents of the deleted memory prior to its access they
      could use this vulnerability to run arbitrary code on a victim&apos;s
      machine.
    * MFSA 2010-57 / CVE-2010-2766: Security researcher regenrecht reported
      via TippingPoint&apos;s Zero Day Initiative that code used to normalize a
      document contained a logical flaw that could be leveraged to run
      arbitrary code. When the normalization code ran, a static count of
      the document&apos;s child nodes was used in the traversal, so a page could
      be constructed that would remove DOM nodes during this normalization
      which could lead to the accessing of a deleted object and potentially
      the execution of attacker-controlled memory.
    * MFSA 2010-58 / CVE-2010-2770: Security researcher Marc Schoenefeld
      reported that a specially crafted font could be applied to a document
      and cause a crash on Mac systems. The crash showed signs of memory
      corruption and presumably could be used by an attacker to execute
      arbitrary code on a victim&apos;s computer.
      This issue probably does not affect the Linux builds and so is listed
      for completeness.
    * MFSA 2010-59 / CVE-2010-2762: Mozilla developer Blake Kaplan reported
      that the wrapper class XPCSafeJSObjectWrapper (SJOW), a security
      wrapper that allows content-defined objects to be safely accessed by
      privileged code, creates scope chains ending in outer objects. Users
      of SJOWs which expect the scope chain to end on an inner object may
      be handed a chrome privileged object which could be leveraged to run
      arbitrary JavaScript with chrome privileges.
      Michal Zalewski&apos;s recent contributions helped to identify this
      architectural weakness.
    * MFSA 2010-60 / CVE-2010-2763: Mozilla security researcher mozbugr_a4
      reported that the wrapper class XPCSafeJSObjectWrapper (SJOW) on the
      Mozilla 1.9.1 development branch has a logical error in its scripted
      function implementation that allows the caller to run the function
      within the context of another site. This is a violation of the
      same-origin policy and could be used to mount an XSS attack.
    * MFSA 2010-61 / CVE-2010-2768: Security researchers David Huang and
      Collin Jackson of Carnegie Mellon University CyLab (Silicon Valley
      campus) reported that the type attribute of an tag can override the
      charset of a framed HTML document, even when the document is included
      across origins. A page could be constructed containing such an tag
      which sets the charset of the framed document to UTF-7. This could
      potentially allow an attacker to inject UTF-7 encoded JavaScript into
      a site, bypassing the site&apos;s XSS filters, and then executing the code
      using the above technique.
    * MFSA 2010-62 / CVE-2010-2769: Security researcher Paul Stone reported
      that when an HTML selection containing JavaScript is copy-and-pasted
      or dropped onto a document with designMode enabled the JavaScript
      will be executed within the context of the site where the code was
      dropped. A malicious site could leverage this issue in an XSS attack
      by persuading a user into taking such an action and in the process
      running malicious JavaScript within the context of another site.
    * MFSA 2010-63 / CVE-2010-2764: Matt Haggard reported that the
      statusText property of an XMLHttpRequest object is readable by the
      requestor even when the request is made across origins. This status
      information reveals the presence of a web server and could be used to
      gather information about servers on internal private networks.
      This issue was also independently reported to Mozilla by Nicholas
      Berthaume

  <description>
This update of glibc fixes two security issues and one bug:

    * CVE-2010-3847: Decoding of the $ORIGIN special value in various LD_
      environment variables allowed local attackers to execute code in
      context of e.g. setuid root programs, elevating privileges.
      This issue does not affect SUSE as an assertion triggers before the
      respective code is executed. The bug was fixed nevertheless.
    * CVE-2010-3856: The LD_AUDIT environment was not pruned during setuid
      root execution and could load shared libraries from standard system
      library paths. This could be used by local attackers to inject code
      into setuid root programs and so elevated privileges.

Additionally a bug in the hconf setup was fixed:

    * disabling gethostbyname4() is not enough for same-family records
      [bnc#572188]

  <summary>Security update for Mozilla Firefox  </summary>
  <description>
This update brings Mozilla Firefox to version 3.6.12, fixing various bugs 
and security issues.

The following security issues were fixed:

    * 

      MFSA 2010-64: Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory
      safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other
      Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory
      corruption under certain circumstances, and we presume that with
      enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
      arbitrary code. References

      Paul Nickerson, Jesse Ruderman, Olli Pettay, Igor Bukanov and Josh
      Soref reported memory safety problems that affected Firefox 3.6 and
      Firefox 3.5.

          o Memory safety bugs - Firefox 3.6, Firefox 3.5
          o CVE-2010-3176

      Gary Kwong, Martijn Wargers and Siddharth Agarwal reported memory
      safety problems that affected Firefox 3.6 only.

          o Memory safety bugs - Firefox 3.6
          o CVE-2010-3175
    * 

      MFSA 2010-65 / CVE-2010-3179: Security researcher Alexander Miller
      reported that passing an excessively long string to document.write
      could cause text rendering routines to end up in an inconsistent
      state with sections of stack memory being overwritten with the string
      data. An attacker could use this flaw to crash a victim&apos;s browser and
      potentially run arbitrary code on their computer.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-66 / CVE-2010-3180: Security researcher Sergey Glazunov
      reported that it was possible to access the locationbar property of a
      window object after it had been closed. Since the closed window&apos;s
      memory could have been subsequently reused by the system it was
      possible that an attempt to access the locationbar property could
      result in the execution of attacker-controlled memory.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-67 / CVE-2010-3183: Security researcher regenrecht reported
      via TippingPoint&apos;s Zero Day Initiative that when window.lookupGetter 
      is called with no arguments the code assumes the top JavaScript stack
      value is a property name. Since there were no arguments passed into
      the function, the top value could represent uninitialized memory or a
      pointer to a previously freed JavaScript object. Under such
      circumstances the value is passed to another subroutine which calls
      through the dangling pointer, potentially executing
      attacker-controlled memory.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-68 / CVE-2010-3177: Google security researcher Robert
      Swiecki reported that functions used by the Gopher parser to convert
      text to HTML tags could be exploited to turn text into executable
      JavaScript. If an attacker could create a file or directory on a
      Gopher server with the encoded script as part of its name the script
      would then run in a victim&apos;s browser within the context of the site.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-69 / CVE-2010-3178: Security researcher Eduardo Vela Nava
      reported that if a web page opened a new window and used a
      javascript: URL to make a modal call, such as alert(), then
      subsequently navigated the page to a different domain, once the modal
      call returned the opener of the window could get access to objects in
      the navigated window. This is a violation of the same-origin policy
      and could be used by an attacker to steal information from another
      web site.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-70 / CVE-2010-3170: Security researcher Richard Moore
      reported that when an SSL certificate was created with a common name
      containing a wildcard followed by a partial IP address a valid SSL
      connection could be established with a server whose IP address
      matched the wildcard range by browsing directly to the IP address. It
      is extremely unlikely that such a certificate would be issued by a
      Certificate Authority.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-71 / CVE-2010-3182: Dmitri Gribenko reported that the
      script used to launch Mozilla applications on Linux was effectively
      including the current working directory in the LDLIBRARYPATH
      environment variable. If an attacker was able to place into the
      current working directory a malicious shared library with the same
      name as a library that the bootstrapping script depends on the
      attacker could have their library loaded instead of the legitimate
      library.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-73 / CVE-2010-3765: Morten Krokvik of Telenor SOC reported
      an exploit targeting particular versions of Firefox 3.6 on Windows XP
      that Telenor found while investigating an intrusion attempt on a
      customer network. The underlying vulnerability, however, was present
      on both the Firefox 3.5 and Firefox 3.6 development branches and
      affected all supported platforms.

  <summary>Security update for Mozilla  </summary>
  <description>
This update brings Mozilla XULRunner to version 1.9.1.14, fixing various 
bugs and security issues.

The following security issues were fixed:

    * 

      MFSA 2010-49 / CVE-2010-3169: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
      several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and
      other Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of
      memory corruption under certain circumstances, and we presume that
      with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
      arbitrary code.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-50 / CVE-2010-2765: Security researcher Chris Rohlf of
      Matasano Security reported that the implementation of the HTML
      frameset element contained an integer overflow vulnerability. The
      code responsible for parsing the frameset columns used an 8-byte
      counter for the column numbers, so when a very large number of
      columns was passed in the counter would overflow. When this counter
      was subsequently used to allocate memory for the frameset, the memory
      buffer would be too small, potentially resulting in a heap buffer
      overflow and execution of attacker-controlled memory.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-51 / CVE-2010-2767: Security researcher Sergey Glazunov
      reported a dangling pointer vulnerability in the implementation of
      navigator.plugins in which the navigator object could retain a
      pointer to the plugins array even after it had been destroyed. An
      attacker could potentially use this issue to crash the browser and
      run arbitrary code on a victim&apos;s computer.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-52 / CVE-2010-3131: Security researcher Haifei Li of
      FortiGuard Labs reported that Firefox could be used to load a
      malicious code library that had been planted on a victim&apos;s computer.
      Firefox attempts to load dwmapi.dll upon startup as part of its
      platform detection, so on systems that don&apos;t have this library, such
      as Windows XP, Firefox will subsequently attempt to load the library
      from the current working directory. An attacker could use this
      vulnerability to trick a user into downloading a HTML file and a
      malicious copy of dwmapi.dll into the same directory on their
      computer and opening the HTML file with Firefox, thus causing the
      malicious code to be executed. If the attacker was on the same
      network as the victim, the malicious DLL could also be loaded via a
      UNC path. The attack also requires that Firefox not currently be
      running when it is asked to open the HTML file and accompanying DLL.
      As this is a Windows only problem, it does not affect the Linux
      version. It is listed for completeness only.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-53 / CVE-2010-3166: Security researcher wushi of team509
      reported a heap buffer overflow in code routines responsible for
      transforming text runs. A page could be constructed with a
      bidirectional text run which upon reflow could result in an incorrect
      length being calculated for the run of text. When this value is
      subsequently used to allocate memory for the text too small a buffer
      may be created potentially resulting in a buffer overflow and the
      execution of attacker controlled memory.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-54 / CVE-2010-2760: Security researcher regenrecht reported
      via TippingPoint&apos;s Zero Day Initiative that there was a remaining
      dangling pointer issue leftover from the fix to CVE-2010-2753. Under
      certain circumstances one of the pointers held by a XUL tree
      selection could be freed and then later reused, potentially resulting
      in the execution of attacker-controlled memory.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-55 / CVE-2010-3168: Security researcher regenrecht reported
      via TippingPoint&apos;s Zero Day Initiative that XUL objects could be
      manipulated such that the setting of certain properties on the object
      would trigger the removal of the tree from the DOM and cause certain
      sections of deleted memory to be accessed. In products based on Gecko
      version 1.9.2 (Firefox 3.6, Thunderbird 3.1) and newer this memory
      has been overwritten by a value that will cause an unexploitable
      crash. In products based on Gecko version 1.9.1 (Firefox 3.5,
      Thunderbird 3.0, and SeaMonkey 2.0) and older an attacker could
      potentially use this vulnerability to crash a victim&apos;s browser and
      run arbitrary code on their computer.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-56 / CVE-2010-3167: Security researcher regenrecht reported
      via TippingPoint&apos;s Zero Day Initiative that the implementation of
      XUL&apos;s content view contains a dangling pointer vulnerability. One of
      the content view&apos;s methods for accessing the internal structure of
      the tree could be manipulated into removing a node prior to accessing
      it, resulting in the accessing of deleted memory. If an attacker can
      control the contents of the deleted memory prior to its access they
      could use this vulnerability to run arbitrary code on a victim&apos;s
      machine.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-57 / CVE-2010-2766: Security researcher regenrecht reported
      via TippingPoint&apos;s Zero Day Initiative that code used to normalize a
      document contained a logical flaw that could be leveraged to run
      arbitrary code. When the normalization code ran, a static count of
      the document&apos;s child nodes was used in the traversal, so a page could
      be constructed that would remove DOM nodes during this normalization
      which could lead to the accessing of a deleted object and potentially
      the execution of attacker-controlled memory.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-58 / CVE-2010-2770: Security researcher Marc Schoenefeld
      reported that a specially crafted font could be applied to a document
      and cause a crash on Mac systems. The crash showed signs of memory
      corruption and presumably could be used by an attacker to execute
      arbitrary code on a victim&apos;s computer. This issue probably does not
      affect the Linux builds and so is listed for completeness.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-59 / CVE-2010-2762: Mozilla developer Blake Kaplan reported
      that the wrapper class XPCSafeJSObjectWrapper (SJOW), a security
      wrapper that allows content-defined objects to be safely accessed by
      privileged code, creates scope chains ending in outer objects. Users
      of SJOWs which expect the scope chain to end on an inner object may
      be handed a chrome privileged object which could be leveraged to run
      arbitrary JavaScript with chrome privileges. Michal Zalewski&apos;s recent
      contributions helped to identify this architectural weakness.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-60 / CVE-2010-2763: Mozilla security researcher mozbugr_a4
      reported that the wrapper class XPCSafeJSObjectWrapper (SJOW) on the
      Mozilla 1.9.1 development branch has a logical error in its scripted
      function implementation that allows the caller to run the function
      within the context of another site. This is a violation of the
      same-origin policy and could be used to mount an XSS attack.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-61 / CVE-2010-2768: Security researchers David Huang and
      Collin Jackson of Carnegie Mellon University CyLab (Silicon Valley
      campus) reported that the type attribute of an tag can override the
      charset of a framed HTML document, even when the document is included
      across origins. A page could be constructed containing such an tag
      which sets the charset of the framed document to UTF-7. This could
      potentially allow an attacker to inject UTF-7 encoded JavaScript into
      a site, bypassing the site&apos;s XSS filters, and then executing the code
      using the above technique.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-62 / CVE-2010-2769: Security researcher Paul Stone reported
      that when an HTML selection containing JavaScript is copy-and-pasted
      or dropped onto a document with designMode enabled the JavaScript
      will be executed within the context of the site where the code was
      dropped. A malicious site could leverage this issue in an XSS attack
      by persuading a user into taking such an action and in the process
      running malicious JavaScript within the context of another site.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-63 / CVE-2010-2764: Matt Haggard reported that the
      statusText property of an XMLHttpRequest object is readable by the
      requestor even when the request is made across origins. This status
      information reveals the presence of a web server and could be used to
      gather information about servers on internal private networks. This
      issue was also independently reported to Mozilla by Nicholas
      Berthaume.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-64: Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory
      safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other
      Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory
      corruption under certain circumstances, and we presume that with
      enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
      arbitrary code. References

      Paul Nickerson, Jesse Ruderman, Olli Pettay, Igor Bukanov and Josh
      Soref reported memory safety problems that affected Firefox 3.6 and
      Firefox 3.5.

          o Memory safety bugs - Firefox 3.6, Firefox 3.5
          o CVE-2010-3176

      Jesse Ruderman reported a crash which affected Firefox 3.5 only.

          o https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=476547
            &lt;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=476547&gt;
          o CVE-2010-3174
    * 

      MFSA 2010-65 / CVE-2010-3179: Security researcher Alexander Miller
      reported that passing an excessively long string to document.write
      could cause text rendering routines to end up in an inconsistent
      state with sections of stack memory being overwritten with the string
      data. An attacker could use this flaw to crash a victim&apos;s browser and
      potentially run arbitrary code on their computer.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-66 / CVE-2010-3180: Security researcher Sergey Glazunov
      reported that it was possible to access the locationbar property of a
      window object after it had been closed. Since the closed window&apos;s
      memory could have been subsequently reused by the system it was
      possible that an attempt to access the locationbar property could
      result in the execution of attacker-controlled memory.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-67 / CVE-2010-3183: Security researcher regenrecht reported
      via TippingPoint&apos;s Zero Day Initiative that when window.lookupGetter 
      is called with no arguments the code assumes the top JavaScript stack
      value is a property name. Since there were no arguments passed into
      the function, the top value could represent uninitialized memory or a
      pointer to a previously freed JavaScript object. Under such
      circumstances the value is passed to another subroutine which calls
      through the dangling pointer, potentially executing
      attacker-controlled memory.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-68 / CVE-2010-3177: Google security researcher Robert
      Swiecki reported that functions used by the Gopher parser to convert
      text to HTML tags could be exploited to turn text into executable
      JavaScript. If an attacker could create a file or directory on a
      Gopher server with the encoded script as part of its name the script
      would then run in a victim&apos;s browser within the context of the site.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-69 / CVE-2010-3178: Security researcher Eduardo Vela Nava
      reported that if a web page opened a new window and used a
      javascript: URL to make a modal call, such as alert(), then
      subsequently navigated the page to a different domain, once the modal
      call returned the opener of the window could get access to objects in
      the navigated window. This is a violation of the same-origin policy
      and could be used by an attacker to steal information from another
      web site.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-70 / CVE-2010-3170: Security researcher Richard Moore
      reported that when an SSL certificate was created with a common name
      containing a wildcard followed by a partial IP address a valid SSL
      connection could be established with a server whose IP address
      matched the wildcard range by browsing directly to the IP address. It
      is extremely unlikely that such a certificate would be issued by a
      Certificate Authority.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-71 / CVE-2010-3182: Dmitri Gribenko reported that the
      script used to launch Mozilla applications on Linux was effectively
      including the current working directory in the LDLIBRARYPATH
      environment variable. If an attacker was able to place into the
      current working directory a malicious shared library with the same
      name as a library that the bootstrapping script depends on the
      attacker could have their library loaded instead of the legitimate
      library.

  <summary>Security update for Mozilla XULrunner  </summary>
  <description>
This update brings the Mozilla XULRunner engine to version 1.9.1.15, fixing 
various bugs and security issues.

The following security issues were fixed:

    * 

      MFSA 2010-64: Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory
      safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other
      Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory
      corruption under certain circumstances, and we presume that with
      enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
      arbitrary code. References

      Paul Nickerson, Jesse Ruderman, Olli Pettay, Igor Bukanov and Josh
      Soref reported memory safety problems that affected Firefox 3.6 and
      Firefox 3.5.

          o Memory safety bugs - Firefox 3.6, Firefox 3.5
          o CVE-2010-3176

      Gary Kwong, Martijn Wargers and Siddharth Agarwal reported memory
      safety problems that affected Firefox 3.6 only.

          o Memory safety bugs - Firefox 3.6
          o CVE-2010-3175
    * 

      MFSA 2010-65 / CVE-2010-3179: Security researcher Alexander Miller
      reported that passing an excessively long string to document.write
      could cause text rendering routines to end up in an inconsistent
      state with sections of stack memory being overwritten with the string
      data. An attacker could use this flaw to crash a victim&apos;s browser and
      potentially run arbitrary code on their computer.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-66 / CVE-2010-3180: Security researcher Sergey Glazunov
      reported that it was possible to access the locationbar property of a
      window object after it had been closed. Since the closed window&apos;s
      memory could have been subsequently reused by the system it was
      possible that an attempt to access the locationbar property could
      result in the execution of attacker-controlled memory.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-67 / CVE-2010-3183: Security researcher regenrecht reported
      via TippingPoint&apos;s Zero Day Initiative that when
      window.__lookupGetter__ is called with no arguments the code assumes
      the top JavaScript stack value is a property name. Since there were
      no arguments passed into the function, the top value could represent
      uninitialized memory or a pointer to a previously freed JavaScript
      object. Under such circumstances the value is passed to another
      subroutine which calls through the dangling pointer, potentially
      executing attacker-controlled memory.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-68 / CVE-2010-3177: Google security researcher Robert
      Swiecki reported that functions used by the Gopher parser to convert
      text to HTML tags could be exploited to turn text into executable
      JavaScript. If an attacker could create a file or directory on a
      Gopher server with the encoded script as part of its name the script
      would then run in a victim&apos;s browser within the context of the site.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-69 / CVE-2010-3178: Security researcher Eduardo Vela Nava
      reported that if a web page opened a new window and used a
      javascript: URL to make a modal call, such as alert(), then
      subsequently navigated the page to a different domain, once the modal
      call returned the opener of the window could get access to objects in
      the navigated window. This is a violation of the same-origin policy
      and could be used by an attacker to steal information from another
      web site.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-70 / CVE-2010-3170: Security researcher Richard Moore
      reported that when an SSL certificate was created with a common name
      containing a wildcard followed by a partial IP address a valid SSL
      connection could be established with a server whose IP address
      matched the wildcard range by browsing directly to the IP address. It
      is extremely unlikely that such a certificate would be issued by a
      Certificate Authority.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-71 / CVE-2010-3182: Dmitri Gribenko reported that the
      script used to launch Mozilla applications on Linux was effectively
      including the current working directory in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
      environment variable. If an attacker was able to place into the
      current working directory a malicious shared library with the same
      name as a library that the bootstrapping script depends on the
      attacker could have their library loaded instead of the legitimate
      library.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-73 / CVE-2010-3765: Morten KrÃ¥kvik of Telenor SOC reported
      an exploit targeting particular versions of Firefox 3.6 on Windows XP
      that Telenor found while investigating an intrusion attempt on a
      customer network. The underlying vulnerability, however, was present
      on both the Firefox 3.5 and Firefox 3.6 development branches and
      affected all supported platforms.

  <description>
The openslp daemon could run into an endless loop when receiving specially 
crafted packets (CVE-2010-3609). This has been fixed.

Additionally the following non-security bugs were fixed:

    * 564504: Fix handling of DA answers if both active and passive DA
      detection is off
    * 597215: Add configuration options to openSLP: net.slp.DASyncReg makes
      slpd query statically configured DAs for registrations,
      net.slp.isDABackup enables periodic writing of remote registrations
      to a backup file which is also read on startup. Both options can be
      used to decrease the time between the start of the slpd daemon and
      slpd knowing all registrations.
    * 601002: reduce CPU usage spikes on machines with many connections by
      using the kernel netlink interface instead of reading the /proc
      filesystem.
    * 626444: Standard compliance was fixed by stripping leading and
      trailing white spaces when doing string comparisons of scopes.

Mozilla Firefox 3.6 was updated to update 3.6.13 fixing several security 
issues.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-74: Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory
      safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other
      Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory
      corruption under certain circumstances, and we presume that with
      enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
      arbitrary code.

      Jesee Ruderman, Andreas Gal, Nils, and Brian Hackett reported memory
      safety problems that affected Firefox 3.6 and Firefox 3.5.
      (CVE-2010-3776)

      Igor Bukanov reported a memory safety problem that was fixed in
      Firefox 3.6 only. (CVE-2010-3777)

      Jesse Ruderman reported a crash which affected Firefox 3.5 only.
      (CVE-2010-3778)

    * 

      MFSA 2010-75 / CVE-2010-3769: Dirk Heinrich reported that on Windows
      platforms when document.write() was called with a very long string a
      buffer overflow was caused in line breaking routines attempting to
      process the string for display. Such cases triggered an invalid read
      past the end of an array causing a crash which an attacker could
      potentially use to run arbitrary code on a victim&apos;s computer.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-76 / CVE-2010-3771: Security researcher echo reported that
      a web page could open a window with an about:blank location and then
      inject an

      element into that page which upon submission would redirect to a
      chrome: document. The effect of this defect was that the original
      page would wind up with a reference to a chrome-privileged object,
      the opened window, which could be leveraged for privilege escalation
      attacks.

      Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 provided proof-of-concept
      code demonstrating how the above vulnerability could be used to run
      arbitrary code with chrome privileges.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-77 / CVE-2010-3772: Security researcher wushi of team509
      reported that when a XUL tree had an HTML

      element nested inside a element then code attempting to display
      content in the XUL tree would incorrectly treat the
      element as a parent node to tree content underneath it resulting in
      incorrect indexes being calculated for the child content. These
      incorrect indexes were used in subsequent array operations which
      resulted in writing data past the end of an allocated buffer. An
      attacker could use this issue to crash a victim&apos;s browser and run
      arbitrary code on their machine.
    * 

      MFSA 2010-78 / CVE-2010-3768: Mozilla added the OTS font sanitizing
      library to prevent downloadable fonts from exposing vulnerabilities
      in the underlying OS font code. This library mitigates against
      several issues independently reported by Red Hat Security Response
      Team member Marc Schoenefeld and Mozilla security researcher
      Christoph Diehl.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-79 / CVE-2010-3775: Security researcher Gregory Fleischer
      reported that when a Java LiveConnect script was loaded via a data:
      URL which redirects via a meta refresh, then the resulting plugin
      object was created with the wrong security principal and thus
      received elevated privileges such as the abilities to read local
      files, launch processes, and create network connections.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-80 / CVE-2010-3766: Security researcher regenrecht reported
      via TippingPoint&apos;s Zero Day Initiative that a nsDOMAttribute node can
      be modified without informing the iterator object responsible for
      various DOM traversals. This flaw could lead to a inconsistent state
      where the iterator points to an object it believes is part of the DOM
      but actually points to some other object. If such an object had been
      deleted and its memory reclaimed by the system, then the iterator
      could be used to call into attacker-controlled memory.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-81 / CVE-2010-3767: Security researcher regenrecht reported
      via TippingPoint&apos;s Zero Day Initiative that JavaScript arrays were
      vulnerable to an integer overflow vulnerability. The report
      demonstrated that an array could be constructed containing a very
      large number of items such that when memory was allocated to store
      the array items, the integer value used to calculate the buffer size
      would overflow resulting in too small a buffer being allocated.
      Subsequent use of the array object could then result in data being
      written past the end of the buffer and causing memory corruption.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-82 / CVE-2010-3773: Mozilla security researcher
      moz_bug_r_a4 reported that the fix for CVE-2010-0179 could be
      circumvented permitting the execution of arbitrary JavaScript with
      chrome privileges.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-83 / CVE-2010-3774: Google security researcher Michal
      Zalewski reported that when a window was opened to a site resulting
      in a network or certificate error page, the opening site could access
      the document inside the opened window and inject arbitrary content.
      An attacker could use this bug to spoof the location bar and trick a
      user into thinking they were on a different site than they actually
      were.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-84 / CVE-2010-3770: Security researchers Yosuke Hasegawa
      and Masatoshi Kimura reported that the x-mac-arabic, x-mac-farsi and
      x-mac-hebrew character encodings are vulnerable to XSS attacks due to
      some characters being converted to angle brackets when displayed by
      the rendering engine. Sites using these character encodings would
      thus be potentially vulnerable to script injection attacks if their
      script filtering code fails to strip out these specific characters.

      MFSA 2010-83 / CVE-2010-3774: Google security researcher Michal
      Zalewski reported that when a window was opened to a site resulting
      in a network or certificate error page, the opening site could access
      the document inside the opened window and inject arbitrary content.
      An attacker could use this bug to spoof the location bar and trick a
      user into thinking they were on a different site than they actually
      were.

    * 

      MFSA 2010-84 / CVE-2010-3770: Security researchers Yosuke Hasegawa
      and Masatoshi Kimura reported that the x-mac-arabic, x-mac-farsi and
      x-mac-hebrew character encodings are vulnerable to XSS attacks due to
      some characters being converted to angle brackets when displayed by
      the rendering engine. Sites using these character encodings would
      thus be potentially vulnerable to script injection attacks if their
      script filtering code fails to strip out these specific characters.

  <summary>Security update for the Linux kernel  </summary>
  <description>
The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 Service Pack 1 kernel was updated to 2.6.32.27 
and fixes various bugs and security issues.

Following security issues were fixed:

    * 

      CVE-2010-4258: A local attacker could use a Oops (kernel crash)
      caused by other flaws to write a 0 byte to a attacker controlled
      address in the kernel. This could lead to privilege escalation
      together with other issues.

    * 

      CVE-2010-4160: A overflow in sendto() and recvfrom() routines was
      fixed that could be used by local attackers to potentially crash the
      kernel using some socket families like L2TP.

    * 

      CVE-2010-4157: A 32bit vs 64bit integer mismatch in gdth_ioctl_alloc
      could lead to memory corruption in the GDTH driver.

    * 

      CVE-2010-4165: The do_tcp_setsockopt function in net/ipv4/tcp.c in
      the Linux kernel did not properly restrict TCP_MAXSEG (aka MSS)
      values, which allowed local users to cause a denial of service (OOPS)
      via a setsockopt call that specifies a small value, leading to a
      divide-by-zero error or incorrect use of a signed integer.

    * 

      CVE-2010-4164: A remote (or local) attacker communicating over X.25
      could cause a kernel panic by attempting to negotiate malformed
      facilities.

    * 

      CVE-2010-4175: A local attacker could cause memory overruns in the
      RDS protocol stack, potentially crashing the kernel. So far it is
      considered not to be exploitable.

    * 

      CVE-2010-4169: Use-after-free vulnerability in mm/mprotect.c in the
      Linux kernel allwed local users to cause a denial of service via
      vectors involving an mprotect system call.

    * 

      CVE-2010-3874: A minor heap overflow in the CAN network module was
      fixed. Due to nature of the memory allocator it is likely not
      exploitable.

    * 

      CVE-2010-4158: A memory information leak in berkely packet filter
      rules allowed local attackers to read uninitialized memory of the
      kernel stack.

    * 

      CVE-2010-4162: A local denial of service in the blockdevice layer was
      fixed.

    * 

      CVE-2010-4163: By submitting certain I/O requests with 0 length, a
      local user could have caused a kernel panic.

    * 

      CVE-2010-3861: The ethtool_get_rxnfc function in net/core/ethtool.c
      in the Linux kernel did not initialize a certain block of heap
      memory, which allowed local users to obtain potentially sensitive
      information via an ETHTOOL_GRXCLSRLALL ethtool command with a large
      info.rule_cnt value.

    * 

      CVE-2010-3881: arch/x86/kvm/x86.c in the Linux kernel did not
      initialize certain structure members, which allowed local users to
      obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory via
      read operations on the /dev/kvm device.

    * 

      CVE-2010-3437: A range checking overflow in pktcdvd ioctl was fixed.

    * 

      CVE-2010-4082: The viafb_ioctl_get_viafb_info function in
      drivers/video/via/ioctl.c in the Linux kernel did not properly
      initialize a certain structure member, which allowed local users to
      obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory via
      a VIAFB_GET_INFO ioctl call.

    * 

      CVE-2010-4073: The ipc subsystem in the Linux kernel did not
      initialize certain structures, which allowed local users to obtain
      potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory via
      vectors related to the (1) compat_sys_semctl, (2) compat_sys_msgctl,
      and (3) compat_sys_shmctl functions in ipc/compat.c; and the (4)
      compat_sys_mq_open and (5) compat_sys_mq_getsetattr functions in
      ipc/compat_mq.c.

    * 

      CVE-2010-4072: The copy_shmid_to_user function in ipc/shm.c in the
      Linux kernel did not initialize a certain structure, which allowed
      local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel
      stack memory via vectors related to the shmctl system call and the
      &quot;old shm interface.&quot;

    * 

      CVE-2010-4083: The copy_semid_to_user function in ipc/sem.c in the
      Linux kernel did not initialize a certain structure, which allowed
      local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel
      stack memory via a (1) IPC_INFO, (2) SEM_INFO, (3) IPC_STAT, or (4)
      SEM_STAT command in a semctl system call.

  <summary>Feature update for usb_modeswitch  </summary>
  <description>
This updates usb_modeswitch to upstream release 1.1.6 which provides 
enhancements to support more USB based UMTS devices.

    * Moved warm-boot driver binding to sh wrapper
    * initial device checking includes current &quot;bConfigurationValue&quot; now,
      should work with config setting for multiple devices
    * made tcl script conform to limitations of &quot;jimsh&quot;, the minimal tcl
      shell (hint from Barry Kauler);
    * fixes for &quot;usbserial&quot; fallback (driver binding for old systems);
    * in the C program, changed parameter &quot;MessageDelay&quot; (hitherto unused)
      to &quot;ReleaseDelay&quot;, to be used in one device configuration
    * Update database to 20101222 state.
    * Added special control message for Kobil devices
    * try to get active configuration for interface class checking
    * fixed &quot;0000&quot; target product ID - again
    * new bash and tcl wrapper logic: the convenience functions for driver
      binding and symlinking will now start the tcl shell ONLY for known
      devices;
    * The package should work at boot time now (cold and warm)
    * Product IDs of &quot;0000&quot; do exist but were not accepted, fixed
    * Response endpoint is now always detected
    * Wrapper script can now work with a packed collection of config files
      as well as with the plain folder of files
    * Wrapper fix for the symlink feature: handling of multiple interrupt
      ports was incomplete
    * Wrapper does not longer use a temporary file for the symlink feature
    * Added delay option to separate multiple message transfers by
      millisecs
    * fixed (possibly dangerous) sloppy string handling
    * Added &quot;clear_halt&quot; for response endpoint
    * Small additions in Makefile (install with -D)
    * Changes in option handling (no more default config file!)
    * Symlink feature in wrapper can now cope with devices providing more
      than one interrupt port
    * Wrapper now ignores package manager leftovers in config folder
    * Replaced bash-specific syntax in wrapper
    * Changed ZTE skipping (if existing rules are found) to warning

  <summary>Recommended update for OpenSLP  </summary>
  <description>
This update adds the new option net.slp.hardMTU to OpenSLP to control the 
size of datagrams sent by the server. With hardMTU turned on, the server 
truncates its answers at 1400 bytes. This can break old or unpatched 
versions of SLP clients that are just looking at the size of the packages 
to detect overflows. For this reason, hardMTU is set to false by default. 
It may be enabled if a router silently drops oversize SLP packets.

The update also fixed an slpd crash caused by a double free() call when a 
DA advertises an invalid url.

  <summary>Security update for Linux kernel  </summary>
  <description>
The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 Service Pack 1 kernel was updated to 2.6.32.29 
and fixes various bugs and security issues.

    * 

      CVE-2010-3875: The ax25_getname function in net/ax25/af_ax25.c in the
      Linux kernel did not initialize a certain structure, which allowed
      local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel
      stack memory by reading a copy of this structure.

    * 

      CVE-2010-3876: net/packet/af_packet.c in the Linux kernel did not
      properly initialize certain structure members, which allowed local
      users to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel stack
      memory by leveraging the CAP_NET_RAW capability to read copies of the
      applicable structures.

    * 

      CVE-2010-3877: The get_name function in net/tipc/socket.c in the
      Linux kernel did not initialize a certain structure, which allowed
      local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel
      stack memory by reading a copy of this structure.

    * 

      CVE-2010-3705: The sctp_auth_asoc_get_hmac function in
      net/sctp/auth.c in the Linux kernel did not properly validate the
      hmac_ids array of an SCTP peer, which allowed remote attackers to
      cause a denial of service (memory corruption and panic) via a crafted
      value in the last element of this array.

    * 

      CVE-2011-0711: A stack memory information leak in the xfs
      FSGEOMETRY_V1 ioctl was fixed.

    * 

      CVE-2011-0712: Multiple buffer overflows in the caiaq Native
      Instruments USB audio functionality in the Linux kernel might have
      allowed attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have
      unspecified other impact via a long USB device name, related to (1)
      the snd_usb_caiaq_audio_init function in sound/usb/caiaq/audio.c and
      (2) the snd_usb_caiaq_midi_init function in sound/usb/caiaq/midi.c.

    * 

      CVE-2011-0710: The task_show_regs function in
      arch/s390/kernel/traps.c in the Linux kernel on the s390 platform
      allowed local users to obtain the values of the registers of an
      arbitrary process by reading a status file under /proc/.

    * 

      CVE-2010-2943: The xfs implementation in the Linux kernel did not
      look up inode allocation btrees before reading inode buffers, which
      allowed remote authenticated users to read unlinked files, or read or
      overwrite disk blocks that are currently assigned to an active file
      but were previously assigned to an unlinked file, by accessing a
      stale NFS filehandle.

    * 

      CVE-2010-4075: The uart_get_count function in
      drivers/serial/serial_core.c in the Linux kernel did not properly
      initialize a certain structure member, which allowed local users to
      obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory via
      a TIOCGICOUNT ioctl call.

    * 

      CVE-2010-4076: The rs_ioctl function in drivers/char/amiserial.c in
      the Linux kernel did not properly initialize a certain structure
      member, which allowed local users to obtain potentially sensitive
      information from kernel stack memory via a TIOCGICOUNT ioctl call.

    * 

      CVE-2010-4077: The ntty_ioctl_tiocgicount function in
      drivers/char/nozomi.c in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize
      a certain structure member, which allowed local users to obtain
      potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory via a
      TIOCGICOUNT ioctl call.

    * 

      CVE-2010-4243: fs/exec.c in the Linux kernel did not enable the OOM
      Killer to assess use of stack memory by arrays representing the (1)
      arguments and (2) environment, which allows local users to cause a
      denial of service (memory consumption) via a crafted exec system
      call, aka an OOM dodging issue, a related issue to CVE-2010-3858.

    * 

      CVE-2010-4668: The blk_rq_map_user_iov function in block/blk-map.c in
      the Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a denial of service
      (panic) via a zero-length I/O request in a device ioctl to a SCSI
      device, related to an unaligned map. NOTE: this vulnerability exists
      because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2010-4163.

    * 

      CVE-2010-4529: Integer underflow in the irda_getsockopt function in
      net/irda/af_irda.c in the Linux kernel on platforms other than x86
      allowed local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from
      kernel heap memory via an IRLMP_ENUMDEVICES getsockopt call.

    * 

      CVE-2010-4342: The aun_incoming function in net/econet/af_econet.c in
      the Linux kernel, when Econet is enabled, allows remote attackers to
      cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) by
      sending an Acorn Universal Networking (AUN) packet over UDP.

    * 

      CVE-2010-3699: The backend driver in Xen 3.x allowed guest OS users
      to cause a denial of service via a kernel thread leak, which
      prevented the device and guest OS from being shut down or create a
      zombie domain, causing a hang in zenwatch, or preventing unspecified
      xm commands from working properly, related to (1) netback, (2)
      blkback, or (3) blktap.

    * 

      CVE-2010-4346: The install_special_mapping function in mm/mmap.c in
      the Linux kernel did not make an expected security_file_mmap function
      call, which allows local users to bypass intended mmap_min_addr
      restrictions and possibly conduct NULL pointer dereference attacks
      via a crafted assembly-language application.

    * 

      CVE-2010-4650: Fixed a verify_ioctl overflow in &quot;cuse&quot; in the fuse
      filesystem. The code should only be called by root users though.

    * 

      CVE-2010-4526: Race condition in the sctp_icmp_proto_unreachable
      function in net/sctp/input.c in the Linux kernel allowed remote
      attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) via an ICMP
      unreachable message to a socket that is already locked by a user,
      which causes the socket to be freed and triggers list corruption,
      related to the sctp_wait_for_connect function.

    * 

      CVE-2010-4527: The load_mixer_volumes function in
      sound/oss/soundcard.c in the OSS sound subsystem in the Linux kernel
      incorrectly expected that a certain name field ends with a &apos;0&apos;
      character, which allowed local users to conduct buffer overflow
      attacks and gain privileges, or possibly obtain sensitive information
      from kernel memory, via a SOUND_MIXER_SETLEVELS ioctl call.

    * 

      CVE-2011-0006: Fixed a LSM bug in IMA (Integrity Measuring
      Architecture). IMA is not enabled in SUSE kernels, so we were not
      affected.

  <summary>Security update for IBM Java  </summary>
  <description>
IBM Java 1.4.2 SR13 was updated to FP8 to fix various bugs and security 
issues.

Following security issues were fixed:

    * 

      CVE-2010-1321: The kg_accept_krb5 function in
      krb5/accept_sec_context.c in the GSS-API library in MIT Kerberos 5
      (aka krb5) through 1.7.1 and 1.8 before 1.8.2, as used in kadmind and
      other applications, does not properly check for invalid GSS-API
      tokens, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of
      service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via an AP-REQ
      message in which the authenticator&apos;s checksum field is missing.

    * 

      CVE-2010-3574: Unspecified vulnerability in the Networking component
      in Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 21, 5.0 Update 25,
      1.4.2_27, and 1.3.1_28 allows remote attackers to affect
      confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors.
      NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the October 2010
      CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims from a reliable downstream
      vendor that HttpURLConnection does not properly check for the
      allowHttpTrace permission, which allows untrusted code to perform
      HTTP TRACE requests.

Mozilla Firefox has been updated to version 3.6.15, fixing the following 
security issues:

    * 

      Several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and
      other Mozilla-based products have been identified and fixed. Some of
      these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
      circumstances, and it is assumed that with enough effort at least
      some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. (MFSA 2011-01
      / CVE-2011-0053
      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0053&gt; , 
      CVE-2011-0062
      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0062&gt; )

    * 

      A recursive call to eval() wrapped in a try/catch statement places
      the browser into a inconsistent state. Any dialog box opened in this
      state is displayed without text and with non-functioning buttons.
      Closing the window causes the dialog to evaluate to true. An attacker
      could use this issue to force a user into accepting any dialog, such
      as one granting elevated privileges to the page presenting the
      dialog. (MFSA 2011-02 / CVE-2011-0051
      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0051&gt; )

    * 

      A method used by JSON.stringify contains a use-after-free error in
      which a currently in-use pointer was freed and subsequently
      dereferenced. This could lead to arbitrary code execution if an
      attacker is able to store malicious code in the freed section of
      memory. (MFSA 2011-03 / CVE-2011-0055
      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0055&gt; )

    * 

      The JavaScript engine&apos;s internal memory mapping of non-local JS
      variables contains a buffer overflow which could potentially be used
      by an attacker to run arbitrary code on a victim&apos;s computer. (MFSA
      2011-04 / CVE-2011-0054
      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0054&gt; )

    * 

      The JavaScript engine&apos;s internal mapping of string values contains an
      error in cases where the number of values being stored is above 64K.
      In such cases an offset pointer is manually moved forwards and
      backwards to access the larger address space. If an exception is
      thrown between the time that the offset pointer was moved forward and
      the time it gets reset, the exception object would be read from an
      invalid memory address, potentially executing attacker-controlled
      memory. (MFSA 2011-05 / CVE-2011-0056
      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0056&gt; )

    * 

      A JavaScript Worker could be used to keep a reference to an object
      that could be freed during garbage collection. Subsequent calls
      through this deleted reference could cause attacker-controlled memory
      to be executed on a victim&apos;s computer. (MFSA 2011-06 / CVE-2011-0057
      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0057&gt; )

    * 

      When very long strings are constructed and inserted into an HTML
      document, the browser incorrectly constructs the layout objects used
      to display the text. Under such conditions an incorrect length would
      be calculated for a text run resulting in too small of a memory
      buffer being allocated to store the text. This issue could be used by
      an attacker to write data past the end of the buffer and execute
      malicious code on a victim&apos;s computer. It affects only Mozilla
      browsers on Windows. (MFSA 2011-07 / CVE-2011-0058
      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0058&gt; )

    * 

      ParanoidFragmentSink, a class used to sanitize potentially unsafe
      HTML for display, allows javascript: URLs and other inline JavaScript
      when the embedding document is a chrome document. While there are no
      unsafe uses of this class in any released products, extension code
      could potentially use it in an unsafe manner. (MFSA 2011-08 / 
      CVE-2010-1585
      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-1585&gt; )

    * 

      A JPEG image can be constructed that will be decoded incorrectly,
      causing data to be written past the end of a buffer created to store
      the image. An attacker could potentially craft such an image that
      would cause malicious code to be stored in memory and then later
      executed on a victim&apos;s computer. (MFSA 2011-09 / CVE-2011-0061
      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0061&gt; )

    * 

      When plugin-initiated requests receive a 307 redirect response, the
      plugin is not notified and the request is forwarded to the new
      location. This is true even for cross-site redirects, so any custom
      headers that were added as part of the initial request would be
      forwarded intact across origins. This poses a CSRF risk for web
      applications that rely on custom headers only being present in
      requests from their own origin. (MFSA 2011-10 / CVE-2011-0059
      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0059&gt; )

  <summary>Recommended update for timezone  </summary>
  <description>
The Olson timezone database has been updated to version 2011c:

This package update contains the following DST-related changes:

    * Pacific/Fiji will end DST 3 weeks earlier than expected - on March 6,
      2011, not March 27, 2011.
    * Pacific/Apia will switch from WSDT to WST on Apr 3; however, the
      precise time of the switch has been incorrect in previous version.
    * Chile (America/Santiago, Pacific/Easter) will postpone the end of DST
      by a month again, this time to help dealing with the water shortage;
      the DST will end on April 3, 2011, not March 13, 2011.

These new zones have been introduced:

    * Mercer County, North Dakota (America/North_Dakota/Beulah) switched
      from the mountain time zone to the central time zone at the last
      transition from daylight-saving to standard time (on Nov. 7, 2010).
    * Detailed information on time changes in some Indian reservations in
      Alaska has been discovered, leading to split of new timezones
      America/Sitka and America/Metlakatla off America/Juneau.

Historical time information has been adjusted for these zones:

    * America/Juneau has been adjusted in accordance with the discovered
      information on Alaska time history.
    * Asia/Hong_Kong declared that daylight saving was used in year 1977,
      while in fact it was not.
    * South Australia (Australia/Adelaide, Australia/Broken_Hill)
      definitions have been cleaned up; the zone binary data changed but
      not the interpretation.
    * Pacific/Honolulu has been corrected to correctly define abandonment
      of local mean time as of 1896 and DST usage between 1942 and 1945.

  <summary>Security update for FUSE  </summary>
  <description>
The following security issues were fixed:

    * CVE-2010-3879: FUSE allowed local users to create mtab entries with
      arbitrary pathnames, and consequently unmount any filesystem, via a
      symlink attack on the parent directory of the mountpoint of a FUSE
      filesystem.
    * CVE-2011-0541: Avoid mounting a directory including evaluation of
      symlinks, which might have allowed local attackers to mount
      filesystems anywhere in the system.
    * CVE-2011-0543: Avoid symlink attacks on the mount point written in
      the mtab file.

Four bugs were fixed:

    * fixed retrying nfs mounts on rpc timeouts
    * allow seperate control of the internet protocol uses by rpc.mount
      seperately of the protocol used by nfs.
    * Fixed locking in libuuid/uuid to avoid duplicate uuids.
    * mkswap bad block check marked every block bad in O(n!) time on a good
      device

New features were implemented:

    * mount now has --fake and --no-canonicalize options, required for the
      symlink security fixes. These were backported from mainline.
    * mount can now auto-detect and differentiate between squashfs3 and
      squashfs (v4) filesystems, allowing backward compatibility to the
      SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 GA codebase.

  <summary>Feature update for strongswan  </summary>
  <description>
This update provides strongSwan 4.4.0, see full changelog at 
http://download.strongswan.org/CHANGES4.txt
&lt;http://download.strongswan.org/CHANGES4.txt&gt; :

    * 

      Added IKEv1 and IKEv2 configuration support for the AES-GMAC
      authentication-only ESP cipher. Our aes_gmac kernel patch or a Linux
      2.6.34 kernel is required to make AES-GMAC available via the XFRM
      kernel interface.

    * 

      Added support for Diffie-Hellman groups 22, 23 and 24 to the
      gmp,gcrypt and openssl plugins, usable by both pluto and charon. The
      new proposal keywords are modp1024s160, modp2048s224 and
      modp2048s256. (fate#309537)

    * 

      The ipsec pki --gen and --pub commands now allow the output of
      private and public keys in PEM format using the --outform pem command
      line option.

    * 

      The existing IKEv2 socket implementations have been migrated to the
      socket-default and the socket-raw plugins. The new socket-dynamic
      plugin binds sockets dynamically to ports configured via the
      left-/rightikeport ipsec.conf connection parameters.

    * 

      The IKEv2 daemon supports RFC 3779 IP address block constraints
      carried as a critical X.509v3 extension in the peer certificate.

    * 

      The Camellia cipher can be used as an IKEv1 encryption algorithm.

    * 

      The IKEv1 and IKEV2 daemons now check certificate path length
      constraints.

    * 

      Added required userland changes for proper SHA256 and SHA384/512 in
      ESP that will be introduced with Linux 2.6.33.

      The &quot;sha256&quot;/&quot;sha2_256&quot; keyword now configures the kernel with 128
      bit truncation, not the non-standard 96 bit truncation used by
      previous releases. To use the old 96 bit truncation scheme, the new
      &quot;sha256_96&quot; proposal keyword has been introduced.

    * 

      Fixed IPComp in tunnel mode, stripping out the duplicated outer
      header. This change makes IPcomp tunnel mode connections incompatible
      with previous releases; disable compression on such tunnels.

    * 

      Fixed BEET mode connections on recent kernels by installing SAs with
      appropriate traffic selectors, based on a patch by Michael Rossberg.

    * 

      Using extensions (such as BEET mode) and crypto algorithms (such as
      twofish, serpent, sha256_96) allocated in the private use space now
      require that we know its meaning, i.e. we are talking to strongSwan.
      Use the new &quot;charon.send_vendor_id&quot; option in strongswan.conf to let
      the remote peer know this is the case.

    * 

      The IKEv1 daemon ignores the Juniper SRX notification type 40001,
      thus allowing interoperability.

  <summary>Recommended update for perl-Bootloader  </summary>
  <description>
This collective update for perl-Bootloader provides the following fixes:

    * 613363: GRUB install writes to passive path of SAN and fails. The fix
      remove workaround for bad geometry of multipath and instead use fixed
      version of multipath-tools which correctly set geometry.
    * 657911: Fix dangling Xen parameters. When Xen boot entry has special
      parameters for xen then spaces is removed and xen stopped booting.
    * 590637: Also handle udev variable DM_NAME containing a partition
      number correctly.

  <summary>Recommended update for ntp  </summary>
  <description>
This update fixes a regression from SLE10 where immediate setting of system 
clock on start up was no longer possible (bnc#611513). By setting the 
NTPD_FORCE_SYNC_ON_STARTUP key in /etc/sysconfig/ntp to &quot;yes&quot; you can 
restore the SLE10 default behavior.

In addition, the Stratum field is now initialized to 0 when responding to 
Kiss packets, which improves compatibility with other servers.

      overflow of the callsign array

    * 

      CVE-2011-1163: The code for evaluating OSF partitions (in
      fs/partitions/osf.c) contained a bug that leaks data from kernel heap
      memory to userspace for certain corrupted OSF partitions.

    * 

      CVE-2011-1093: A bug in the order of dccp_rcv_state_process() was
      fixed that still permitted reception even after closing the socket. A
      Reset after close thus causes a NULL pointer dereference by not
      preventing operations on an already torn-down socket.

    * 

      CVE-2011-1013: A signedness issue in drm_modeset_ctl() could be used
      by local attackers with access to the drm devices to potentially
      crash the kernel or escalate privileges.

    * 

      CVE-2011-1082: The epoll subsystem in Linux did not prevent users
      from creating circular epoll file structures, potentially leading to
      a denial of service (kernel deadlock).

    * 

      CVE-2011-0712: Multiple buffer overflows in the caiaq Native
      Instruments USB audio functionality in the Linux kernel might have
      allowed attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have
      unspecified other impact via a long USB device name, related to (1)
      the snd_usb_caiaq_audio_init function in sound/usb/caiaq/audio.c and
      (2) the snd_usb_caiaq_midi_init function in sound/usb/caiaq/midi.c.

    * 

      CVE-2011-1182: Local attackers could send signals to their programs
      that looked like coming from the kernel, potentially gaining
      privileges in the context of setuid programs.

    * 

      CVE-2011-1478: An issue in the core GRO code where an skb belonging
      to an unknown VLAN is reused could result in a NULL pointer
      dereference.

    * 

      CVE-2011-1476: Specially crafted requests may be written to
      /dev/sequencer resulting in an underflow when calculating a size for
      a copy_from_user() operation in the driver for MIDI interfaces. On
      x86, this just returns an error, but it could have caused memory
      corruption on other architectures. Other malformed requests could
      have resulted in the use of uninitialized variables.

    * 

      CVE-2011-1477: Due to a failure to validate user-supplied indexes in
      the driver for Yamaha YM3812 and OPL-3 chips, a specially crafted
      ioctl request could have been sent to /dev/sequencer, resulting in
      reading and writing beyond the bounds of heap buffers, and
      potentially allowing privilege escalation.

    * 

      CVE-2011-0191: A information leak in the XFS geometry calls could be
      used by local attackers to gain access to kernel information.

    * 

      CVE-2011-1090: A page allocator issue in NFS v4 ACL handling that
      could lead to a denial of service (crash) was fixed.

    * 

      CVE-2010-3880: net/ipv4/inet_diag.c in the Linux kernel did not
      properly audit INET_DIAG bytecode, which allowed local users to cause
      a denial of service (kernel infinite loop) via crafted
      INET_DIAG_REQ_BYTECODE instructions in a netlink message that
      contains multiple attribute elements, as demonstrated by
      INET_DIAG_BC_JMP instructions.

    * 

      CVE-2010-4656: Fixed a buffer size issue in &quot;usb iowarrior&quot; module,
      where a malicious device could overflow a kernel buffer.

    * 

      CVE-2011-0521: The dvb_ca_ioctl function in
      drivers/media/dvb/ttpci/av7110_ca.c in the Linux kernel did not check
      the sign of a certain integer field, which allowed local users to
      cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have
      unspecified other impact via a negative value.

    * 

      CVE-2011-1180: In the IrDA module, length fields provided by a peer
      for names and attributes may be longer than the destination array
      sizes and were not checked, this allowed local attackers (close to
      the irda port) to potentially corrupt memory.

    * 

      CVE-2010-4251: A system out of memory condition (denial of service)
      could be triggered with a large socket backlog, exploitable by local
      users. This has been addressed by backlog limiting.

    * 

      CVE-2011-1016: The Radeon GPU drivers in the Linux kernel did not
      properly validate data related to the AA resolve registers, which
      allowed local users to write to arbitrary memory locations associated
      with (1) Video RAM (aka VRAM) or (2) the Graphics Translation Table
      (GTT) via crafted values.

    * 

      CVE-2011-1573: Boundschecking was missing in AARESOLVE_OFFSET, which
      allowed local attackers to overwrite kernel memory and so escalate
      privileges or crash the kernel.

      revealed a specific valid address of an object on the memory heap. It
      is possible that in some cases this address would be valuable
      information that could be used by an attacker while exploiting a
      different memory corruption but, in order to make an exploit more
      reliable or work around mitigation features in the browser or
      operating system.

  <summary>Recommended update for stunnel  </summary>
  <description>
This update provides stunnel version 4.36, which introduces two new 
configuration options:

    * 

      libwrap = no
      turns off usage of libwrap. This can greatly improve performance of
      stunnel. Due to security implications this setting should only be
      used within controlled environments

    * 

      listenqueue = value
      The new package defaults to SOMAXCON (128) for the socket queue
      length. Old versions of stunnel had a fixed value of 5. Using above
      option in the configuraion file users can chose the setting between 0
      and 128. The default is 128.

Further to the new features, many bugs were fixed, among them:

    * Missing pthread_attr_destroy() added to fix memory leak
    * Fixed the incorrect way of setting FD_CLOEXEC flag
    * Retry implemented on EAI_AGAIN error returned by resolver calls.
    * Fixed a transfer() loop issue on socket errors

This is a collective update for xkeyboard-config that provides the 
configuration necessary for handling the Indian Rupee symbol.

    * Most keyboards have only 3 indicators which by convention are Num,
      Caps and Scroll Lock. Shift lock usually occupies the 4th indicator
      which is not present on most keyboards. This patch treats Shift Lock
      like the other lockings and adds a rule to let Shift Lock toggle the
      Caps Lock LED. To do so simply add the XKB option:
      &quot;caps_led:shiftlock&quot;. (bnc #523511)
    * Add support for special canadian keyboard layout for IBM POS systems
      (bnc #558684)
    * Add copyright/cent symbols to &quot;in(eng)&quot; keyboard layout

In addition, a new version of the dejavu font is included that adds the 
needed glyph.

    * 632290: Applied fix extracted from git, correcting to acquire a

  <summary>Security update for Linux kernel  </summary>
  <description>
The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 Service Pack 1 kernel was updated to 2.6.32.43 
and fixes various bugs and security issues.

The following security issues were fixed:

    * 

      CVE-2011-2496: The normal mmap paths all avoid creating a mapping
      where the pgoff inside the mapping could wrap around due to overflow.
      However, an expanding mremap() can take such a non-wrapping mapping
      and make it bigger and cause a wrapping condition.

    * 

      CVE-2011-2491: A local unprivileged user able to access a NFS
      filesystem could use file locking to deadlock parts of an nfs server
      under some circumstance.

    * 

      CVE-2011-2183: Fixed a race between ksmd and other memory management
      code, which could result in a NULL ptr dereference and kernel crash.

    * 

      CVE-2011-2517: In both trigger_scan and sched_scan operations, we
      were checking for the SSID length before assigning the value
      correctly. Since the memory was just kzalloced, the check was always
      failing and SSID with over 32 characters were allowed to go through.
      This required CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges to be exploited.

    * 

      CVE-2011-2213: A malicious user or buggy application could inject
      diagnosing byte code and trigger an infinite loop in
      inet_diag_bc_audit().

    * 

      CVE-2011-1017,CVE-2011-1012,CVE-2011-2182: The code for evaluating
      LDM partitions (in fs/partitions/ldm.c) contained bugs that could
      crash the kernel for certain corrupted LDM partitions.

    * 

      CVE-2011-1593: Multiple integer overflows in the next_pidmap function
      in kernel/pid.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a
      denial of service (system crash) via a crafted (1) getdents or (2)
      readdir system call.

    * 

      CVE-2011-1020: The proc filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel
      did not restrict access to the /proc directory tree of a process
      after this process performs an exec of a setuid program, which
      allowed local users to obtain sensitive information or cause a denial
      of service via open, lseek, read, and write system calls.

    * 

      CVE-2011-1585: When using a setuid root mount.cifs, local users could
      hijack password protected mounted CIFS shares of other local users.

    * 

      CVE-2011-1160: Kernel information via the TPM devices could by used
      by local attackers to read kernel memory.

    * 

      CVE-2011-1577: The Linux kernel automatically evaluated partition
      tables of storage devices. The code for evaluating EFI GUID
      partitions (in fs/partitions/efi.c) contained a bug that causes a
      kernel oops on certain corrupted GUID partition tables, which might
      be used by local attackers to crash the kernel or potentially execute
      code.

    * 

      CVE-2011-1078: In a bluetooth ioctl, struct sco_conninfo has one
      padding byte in the end. Local variable cinfo of type sco_conninfo
      was copied to userspace with this uninizialized one byte, leading to
      an old stack contents leak.

    * 

      CVE-2011-1079: In a bluetooth ioctl, struct ca is copied from
      userspace. It was not checked whether the &quot;device&quot; field was NULL
      terminated. This potentially leads to BUG() inside of
      alloc_netdev_mqs() and/or information leak by creating a device with
      a name made of contents of kernel stack.

    * 

      CVE-2011-1080: In ebtables rule loading, struct tmp is copied from
      userspace. It was not checked whether the &quot;name&quot; field is NULL
      terminated. This may have lead to buffer overflow and passing
      contents of kernel stack as a module name to
      try_then_request_module() and, consequently, to modprobe commandline.
      It would be seen by all userspace processes.

    * 

      CVE-2011-1173: The econet_sendmsg function in net/econet/af_econet.c
      in the Linux kernel on the x86_64 platform allowed remote attackers
      to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory
      by reading uninitialized data in the ah field of an Acorn Universal
      Networking (AUN) packet.

    * 

      CVE-2011-1170: net/ipv4/netfilter/arp_tables.c in the IPv4
      implementation in the Linux kernel did not place the expected &apos;0&apos;
      character at the end of string data in the values of certain
      structure members, which allowed local users to obtain potentially
      sensitive information from kernel memory by leveraging the
      CAP_NET_ADMIN capability to issue a crafted request, and then reading
      the argument to the resulting modprobe process.

    * 

      CVE-2011-1171: net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_tables.c in the IPv4
      implementation in the Linux kernel did not place the expected &apos;0&apos;
      character at the end of string data in the values of certain
      structure members, which allowed local users to obtain potentially
      sensitive information from kernel memory by leveraging the
      CAP_NET_ADMIN capability to issue a crafted request, and then reading
      the argument to the resulting modprobe process.

    * 

      CVE-2011-1172: net/ipv6/netfilter/ip6_tables.c in the IPv6
      implementation in the Linux kernel did not place the expected &apos;0&apos;
      character at the end of string data in the values of certain
      structure members, which allowed local users to obtain potentially
      sensitive information from kernel memory by leveraging the
      CAP_NET_ADMIN capability to issue a crafted request, and then reading
      the argument to the resulting modprobe process.

    * 

      CVE-2011-1746: Multiple integer overflows in the (1)
      agp_allocate_memory and (2) agp_create_user_memory functions in
      drivers/char/agp/generic.c in the Linux kernel before allowed local
      users to trigger buffer overflows, and consequently cause a denial of
      service (system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact, via
      vectors related to calls that specify a large number of memory pages.

    * 

      CVE-2011-1745: Integer overflow in the agp_generic_insert_memory
      function in drivers/char/agp/generic.c in the Linux kernel allowed
      local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (system
      crash) via a crafted AGPIOC_BIND agp_ioctl ioctl call.

    * 

      CVE-2011-1598: The bcm_release function in net/can/bcm.c in the Linux
      kernel did not properly validate a socket data structure, which
      allowed local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
      dereference) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted
      release operation.

    * 

      CVE-2011-1748: The raw_release function in net/can/raw.c in the Linux
      kernel did not properly validate a socket data structure, which
      allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
      dereference) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted
      release operation.

  <summary>Recommended update for acpid  </summary>
  <description>
This update of acpid improves the socket handling by not putting it in 
blocking mode anymore. This allowed local client to cause a denial of 
service condition.

Additionally a missing close on disconnected sockets which causes acpid to 
write large log files was fixed.

  <description>
This update provides a version update of gawk to version 3.1.8, including 
many fixes and performance improvements. Noteworthy changes are:

    * The zero flag no longer applies to %c and %s; apparently the
      standards changed at some point.
    * Failure to open a socket is no longer a fatal error.
    * dfa.h and dfa.c are now more-or-less in sync with GNU grep, for the
      first time in many years.
    * Gawk no longer includes its own copy of libsigsegv but it will use it
      if installed on the build system.The --disable-libsigsegv configure
      option is now gone.
    * The &apos; flag (%&apos;d) is now just ignored on systems that can&apos;t support
      it.
    * Gawk now has support for z/OS (IBM S/390 architecture).
    * Gawk now handles multibyte strings better in [s]printf with field
      widths and such.
    * A getline from a directory is no longer fatal; instead it returns -1.
    * Per POSIX, special variable names (like FS) cannot be used as
      function parameter names.
    * The new -O / --optimize option enables simple constant folding on the
      parse tree during parsing. We hope that with time the number of
      optimizations will increase.
    * Lots of bug fixes, see the ChangeLog.

  <summary>Security update for Mozilla Firefox  </summary>
  <description>
Mozilla Firefox was updated to version 3.6.20.

It fixes bugs and security issues. Following security issues were fixed: 
Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2011-30 - MFSA 2011-30
&lt;http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2011/mfsa2011-30.html&gt;

    * 

      Miscellaneous memory safety hazards

      Mozilla developers and community members identified and fixed several
      memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox 3.6 and
      other Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of
      memory corruption under certain circumstances, and we presume that
      with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
      arbitrary code.

      Gary Kwong, Igor Bukanov, Nils and Bob Clary reported memory safety
      issues which affected Firefox 3.6. (CVE-2011-2982)

    * 

      Crash in SVGTextElement.getCharNumAtPosition()

      Security researcher regenrecht reported via TippingPoint&apos;s Zero Day
      Initiative that a SVG text manipulation routine contained a dangling
      pointer vulnerability. (CVE-2011-0084)

    * 

      Privilege escalation using event handlers

      Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a_4 reported a vulnerability in
      event management code that would permit JavaScript to be run in the
      wrong context, including that of a different website or potentially
      in a chrome-privileged context. (CVE-2011-2981)

    * 

      Dangling pointer vulnerability in appendChild

      Security researcher regenrecht reported via TippingPoint&apos;s Zero Day
      Initiative that appendChild did not correctly account for DOM objects
      it operated upon and could be exploited to dereference an invalid
      pointer. (CVE-2011-2378)

    * 

      Privilege escalation dropping a tab element in content area

      Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reported that web content
      could receive chrome privileges if it registered for drop events and
      a browser tab element was dropped into the content area.
      (CVE-2011-2984)

    * 

      Binary planting vulnerability in ThinkPadSensor::Startup

      Security researcher Mitja Kolsek of Acros Security reported that
      ThinkPadSensor::Startup could potentially be exploited to load a
      malicious DLL into the running process. (CVE-2011-2980) (This issue
      is likely Windows only)

    * 

      Private data leakage using RegExp.input

      Security researcher shutdown reported that data from other domains
      could be read when RegExp.input was set. (CVE-2011-2983)

  <description>
The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 Service Pack 1 kernel was updated to 2.6.32.45 
and fixes various bugs and security issues.

The following security issues have been fixed:

    * 

      CVE-2011-1776: Timo Warns reported an issue in the Linux
      implementation for GUID partitions. Users with physical access could
      gain access to sensitive kernel memory by adding a storage device
      with a specially crafted corrupted invalid partition table.

    * 

      CVE-2010-3881: The second part of this fix was not yet applied to our
      kernel: arch/x86/kvm/x86.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.36.2 does
      not initialize certain structure members, which allows local users to
      obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory via
      read operations on the /dev/kvm device.

    * 

      CVE-2011-2495: The /proc/PID/io interface could be used by local
      attackers to gain information on other processes like number of
      password characters typed or similar.

    * 

      CVE-2011-2700: A small buffer overflow in the radio driver si4713-i2c
      was fixed that could potentially used by local attackers to crash the
      kernel or potentially execute code.

    * 

      CVE-2011-2909: A kernel information leak in the comedi driver from
      kernel to userspace was fixed.

    * 

      CVE-2011-2918: In the perf framework software event overflows could
      deadlock or delete an uninitialized timer.

  <summary>Recommended update for yast2-installation  </summary>
  <description>
This update for yast2-installation provides the following fixes:

    * Fixed network interface names in initrd: iSCSI machines with more
      than one NIC would sometimes not boot (bnc#666079).
    * Fixed update.tar.gz of a Driver-Update-Disk no longer being extracted
      to / (bnc#626337).
    * The license agreement text area is now wider (bnc#607135).

This update will only help if present at system installation time already 
(for example as a Driver-Update-Disk or with a remastered DVD).

  <description>
This update fixes a remote denial of service bug (memory exhaustion) in the 
Apache 2 HTTP server, that could be triggered by remote attackers using 
multiple overlapping Request Ranges. (CVE-2011-3192)

It also fixes a issue in mod_dav, where the (1) mod_cache and (2) mod_dav 
modules in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x allowed remote attackers to cause a 
denial of service (process crash) via a request that lacks a path. 
(CVE-2010-1452)

Also following bugs were fixed:

    * recommend the default MPM (prefork) via Recommends: in .spec
    * apache not sending error 304 if mod_deflate is enabled.

  <summary>Recommended update for sudo  </summary>
  <description>
This update for sudo provides a version update to 1.7.6p2 which enhances 
LDAP support and provides many individual bug fixes:

    * Two-character CIDR-style IPv4 netmasks are now matched correctly in
      the sudoers file.
    * Removed extraneous parens in LDAP filter when sudoers_search_filter
      is enabled that can cause an LDAP search error.
    * A new LDAP setting, sudoers_search_filter, has been added to
      ldap.conf. This setting can be used to restrict the set of records
      returned by the LDAP query.
    * White space is now permitted within a User_List when used in
      conjunction with a per-user Defaults definition.
    * A group ID (%#gid) may now be specified in a User_List or Runas_List.
      Likewise, for non-Unix groups the syntax is %:#gid.
    * A bug that could result in corrupted output in &quot;sudo -l&quot; has been
      fixed.
    * LDAP Sudoers entries may now specify a time period for which the
      entry is valid. This requires an updated sudoers schema that includes
      the sudoNotBefore and sudoNotAfter attributes. Support for timed
      entries must be explicitly enabled in the ldap.conf file.
    * Time stamp files have moved from /var/run/sudo to either
      /var/db/sudo, /var/lib/sudo or /var/adm/sudo. The directories are
      checked for existence in that order. This prevents users from
      receiving the sudo lecture every time the system reboots.
    * Time stamp files older than the boot time are ignored on systems
      where it is possible to determine this.
    * Defaults settings that are tied to a user, host or command may now
      include the negation operator.
    * Support for logging I/O for the command being run.
    * Sudoers now supports a #include facility to allow the inclusion of
      other sudoers-format files.
    * The &quot;secure_path&quot; run-time Defaults option has been restored.
    * Password and group data is now cached for fast lookups.
    * A new Defaults option, &quot;mailfrom&quot; that sets the value of the &quot;From:&quot;
      field in the warning/error mail. If unspecified, the login name of
      the invoking user is used.
    * A new Defaults option, &quot;env_file&quot; that refers to a file containing
      environment variables to be set in the command being run.
    * Support for double-quoted words in the sudoers file has been fixed.
      The change in 1.7.5 for escaping the double quote character caused
      the double quoting to only be available at the beginning of an entry.

  <summary>Recommended update for sblim-sfcb  </summary>
  <description>
This update fixes two issues:

    * The sfcb CIMOM uses the IPv6 stack for its network connection and
      failed to attach to the network if IPv6 was disabled in the operating
      system. This fix provides a proper fallback to IPv4 for such cases.
    * Large requests via SSL would have failed with timeout for requests
      with a large body. Such requests didn&apos;t completely fit into sfcb&apos;s
      internal http buffer and required one more read from the socket. The
      fix is to check the SSL decrypt buffer first before reading from the
      connection socket.

  <description>
Mozilla Firefox was updated to version 3.6.23, fixing various bugs and 
security issues.

    * 

      MFSA 2011-36: Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory
      safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other
      Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory
      corruption under certain circumstances, and we presume that with
      enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
      arbitrary code.

      In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
      Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled,,
      but are potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in
      those products.

      Benjamin Smedberg, Bob Clary, and Jesse Ruderman reported memory
      safety problems that affected Firefox 3.6 and Firefox 6.
      (CVE-2011-2995)

      Josh Aas reported a potential crash in the plugin API that affected
      Firefox 3.6 only. (CVE-2011-2996)

    * 

      MFSA 2011-37: Mark Kaplan reported a potentially exploitable crash
      due to integer underflow when using a large JavaScript RegExp
      expression. We would also like to thank Mark for contributing the fix
      for this problem. (no CVE yet)

    * 

      MFSA 2011-38: Mozilla developer Boris Zbarsky reported that a frame
      named &quot;location&quot; could shadow the window.location object unless a
      script in a page grabbed a reference to the true object before the
      frame was created. Because some plugins use the value of
      window.location to determine the page origin this could fool the
      plugin into granting the plugin content access to another site or the
      local file system in violation of the Same Origin Policy. This flaw
      allows circumvention of the fix added for MFSA 2010-10.
      (CVE-2011-2999)

    * 

      MFSA 2011-39: Ian Graham of Citrix Online reported that when multiple
      Location headers were present in a redirect response Mozilla behavior
      differed from other browsers: Mozilla would use the second Location
      header while Chrome and Internet Explorer would use the first. Two
      copies of this header with different values could be a symptom of a
      CRLF injection attack against a vulnerable server. Most commonly it
      is the Location header itself that is vulnerable to the response
      splitting and therefore the copy preferred by Mozilla is more likely
      to be the malicious one. It is possible, however, that the first copy
      was the injected one depending on the nature of the server
      vulnerability.

      The Mozilla browser engine has been changed to treat two copies of
      this header with different values as an error condition. The same has
      been done with the headers Content-Length and Content-Disposition.
      (CVE-2011-3000)

    * 

      MFSA 2011-40: Mariusz Mlynski reported that if you could convince a
      user to hold down the Enter key--as part of a game or test,
      perhaps--a malicious page could pop up a download dialog where the
      held key would then activate the default Open action. For some file
      types this would be merely annoying (the equivalent of a pop-up) but
      other file types have powerful scripting capabilities. And this would
      provide an avenue for an attacker to exploit a vulnerability in
      applications not normally exposed to potentially hostile internet
      content.

      Holding enter allows arbitrary code execution due to Download Manager
      (CVE-2011-2372)

  <summary>Security update for Linux kernel  </summary>
  <description>
The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 Service Pack 1 kernel was updated to 2.6.32.46 
and fixes various bugs and security issues.

The following security issues have been fixed:

    * 

      CVE-2011-3191: A signedness issue in CIFS could possibly have lead to
      to memory corruption, if a malicious server could send crafted
      replies to the host.

    * 

      CVE-2011-3353: In the fuse filesystem, FUSE_NOTIFY_INVAL_ENTRY did
      not check the length of the write so the message processing could
      overrun and result in a BUG_ON() in fuse_copy_fill(). This flaw could
      be used by local users able to mount FUSE filesystems to crash the
      system.

    * 

      CVE-2011-2928: The befs_follow_link function in fs/befs/linuxvfs.c in
      the Linux kernel did not validate the length attribute of long
      symlinks, which allowed local users to cause a denial of service
      (incorrect pointer dereference and OOPS) by accessing a long symlink
      on a malformed Be filesystem.

  <summary>Recommended update for augeas  </summary>
  <description>
This update provides an update of augeas to version 0.8.1. Augeas is a 
library for programmatically editing configuration files. Augeas parses 
configuration files into a tree structure, which it exposes through its 
public API. Changes made through the API are written back to the initially 
read files.

The transformation works very hard to preserve comments and formatting 
details. It is controlled by &quot;lens&quot; definitions that describe the file 
format and the transformation into a tree.

This release contains a number of bugfixes, most importantly one that 
addresses an issue with mutlithreaded programs that use multiple &apos;struct 
augeas&apos; instances, like libvirt (BZ 690286). Path expressions support 
regexp matches and unions of nodesets. Augeas can now be run under non-C 
locales (this mostly affects users of the Perl and Java bindings). The API 
now contains several functions (aug_error and friends) to do more 
fine-grained error reporting. Bugfixes to many lenses, and the addition of 
lenses for /etc/ethers, /etc/postfix/access, and Wine registry-

  <summary>Security update for Xorg  </summary>
  <description>
This update for xorg-x11-server and xorg-x11-libs brings improved 
compatibility fixes and enhancements for X.org. The main feature is support 
for Multi monitor configurations with independent heads, which used to be 
supported with SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 (VGA Arbitration Support).

During update to Service Pack 1, the support for AppGroup Extension was 
removed from the X11 Server. This update fixes this regression and adds 
back the support (bnc#709943).

Additionally this update fixes bugs in the AppGroup Extensions, which 
resulted in Xserver crashes (bnc #716355).

It also fixes an issue with changing the mouse mode to absolute 
(bnc#704467).

It also fixes an issue with button release on non-core pointing devices 
(bnc#698281).

In addition to that, multiple missing or incorrect bounds checking flaws 
were fixed in in GLX (CVE-2010-4818) and in the X Render Extension 
(CVE-2010-4819) were fixed, which could be used to crash the X server.

A regression in handling TWM was fixed as well (bnc#709987).

  <summary>Security update for Apache2  </summary>
  <description>
This update brings Apache to version 2.2.12.

The main reason is the enablement of the Server Name Indication (SNI) that 
allows several SSL-enabled domains on one IP address (FATE#311973). See the 
SSLStrictSNIVHostCheck directive as documented in 
/usr/share/apache2/manual/mod/mod_ssl.html.en

Also the patch for the ByteRange remote denial of service attack 
(CVE-2011-3192) was refined and the configuration options used by upstream 
were added.

Introduce new config option: Allow MaxRanges
Number of ranges requested, if exceeded, the complete content is served.
default: 200
0|unlimited: unlimited
none: Range headers are ignored.
This option is a backport from 2.2.21.

Also fixed were

    * CVE-2011-3348: Denial of service in proxy_ajp when using a undefined
      method.
    * CVE-2011-3368: Exposure of internal servers via reverse proxy methods
      with mod_proxy enabled and incorrect Rewrite or Proxy Rules.

This update also includes a newer apache2-vhost-ssl.template, which 
disables SSLv2, and allows SSLv3 and strong ciphers only. Please note that 
existing vhosts will not be converted.

  <summary>Security update for puppet  </summary>
  <description>
The following security issues have been fixed:

    * 

      Puppet&apos;s certificate authority issued Puppet agent certificates
      capable of impersonating the Puppet master. Compromised or rogue
      puppet agents could therefore use their certificates for MITM attacks
      (CVE-2011-3872).

      Note: If you&apos;ve set the &apos;certdnsnames&apos; option in your master&apos;s
      puppet.conf file merely installing the updated packages is not
      sufficient to fix this problem. You need to either pick a new DNS
      name for the master and reconfigure all agents to use it or re-new
      certificates on all agents.

      Please refer to the documentation in
      /usr/share/doc/packages/puppet/puppetlabs-cve20113872-0.0.5
      for detailed instructions and scripts.

      Puppetlabs&apos; site also provides more information:

    * 

      Directory traversal vulnerability in puppet allowed unauthenticated
      remote attackers to upload x.509 certificate signing requests to
      arbitrary locations (CVE-2011-3848)

    * 

      Puppet was prone to several symlink attacks (CVE-2011-3870,
      CVE-2011-3869, CVE-2011-3871)

  <summary>Security update for Linux kernel  </summary>
  <description>
The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 Service Pack 1 kernel has been updated to 
version 2.6.32.49 and fixes various bugs and security issues.

    * CVE-2011-3188: The TCP/IP initial sequence number generation
      effectively only used 24 bits of 32 to generate randomness, making a
      brute force man-in-the-middle attack on TCP/IP connections feasible.
      The generator was changed to use full 32bit randomness.
    * CVE-2011-2699: Fernando Gont discovered that the IPv6 stack used
      predictable fragment identification numbers. A remote attacker could
      exploit this to exhaust network resources, leading to a denial of
      service.
    * CVE-2011-2203: A NULL ptr dereference on mounting corrupt hfs
      filesystems was fixed which could be used by local attackers to crash
      the kernel.
    * CVE-2011-1833: Added a kernel option to ensure ecryptfs is mounting
      only on paths belonging to the current ui, which would have allowed
      local attackers to potentially gain privileges via symlink attacks.
    * CVE-2011-1576: The Generic Receive Offload (GRO) implementation in
      the Linux kernel allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of
      service via crafted VLAN packets that are processed by the
      napi_reuse_skb function, leading to (1) a memory leak or (2) memory
      corruption, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-1478.
    * CVE-2011-4330: A name overflow in the hfs filesystem was fixed, where
      mounting a corrupted hfs filesystem could lead to a stack overflow
      and code execution in the kernel. This requires a local attacker to
      be able to mount hfs filesystems.
    * CVE-2011-4326: A bug was found in the way headroom check was
      performed in udp6_ufo_fragment() function. A remote attacker could
      use this flaw to crash the system.

The following non-security bugs has been fixed:

    * ALSA: hda - Fix S3/S4 problem on machines with VREF-pin mute-LED
      (bnc#732535).
    * patches.xen/xen-pcpu-hotplug: Fix a double kfree().
    * ixgbe: fix bug with vlan strip in promsic mode (bnc#687049,

    * ALSA: hda - Keep vref-LED during power-saving on IDT codecs
      (bnc#731981).
    * cifs: Assume passwords are encoded according to iocharset
      (bnc#731035).
    * scsi_dh: Check queuedata pointer before proceeding (bnc#714744).
    * netback: use correct index for invalidation in netbk_tx_check_mop().
    * ACPI video: introduce module parameter
      video.use_bios_initial_backlight (bnc#731229).
    * SUNRPC: prevent task_cleanup running on freed xprt (bnc#709671).
    * add device entry for Broadcom Valentine combo card (bnc#722429).
    * quota: Fix WARN_ON in lookup_one_len (bnc#728626).
    * Update Xen patches to 2.6.32.48.
    * pv-on-hvm/kexec: add xs_reset_watches to shutdown watches from old
      kernel (bnc#694863).

  <summary>Recommended update for spamassassin  </summary>
  <description>
This update provides spamassassin 3.3.1 with many improvements and fixes:

    * IPv6 support was substantially improved
    * many improvements to the DKIM plugin (understands author domain
      signatures, supports multiple signatures, ADSP support with
      overrides)
    * added a configuration option &apos;time_limit&apos;, defaulting to 300 seconds
      or whatever the caller (like spamd) provides; attempting to
      gracefully terminate the checking when a time limit is reached,
      reporting the score and test hits that were collected so far, along
      with an added hit on a rule TIME_LIMIT_EXCEEDED;
    * configurable network mask length for the AWL plugin
    * added IPv6 support for trusted_networks, internal_networks,
      msa_networks, whitelist_from_rcvd, and other stuff that uses NetSet
      and the Received header field parser, using NetAddr::IP;
    * allowed usage of a remote dccifd host through an INET or INET6
      socket;
    * added IPv6 support to AWL plugin and its utility modules; a network
      mask length is now configurable and defaults to /48, which controls
      what data is stored in an AWL database;
    * IP_PRIVATE now includes ipv6 variants of private address space as
      well as the ipv6-mapped ipv4 addresses.
    * NetSet now understands that ::ffff:192.168.1.2 and 192.168.1.2 are
      the same address;
    * IPv6 addresses are now properly read from Received header fields;
    * when reading Received header fields, the &quot;IPv6:&quot; prefix is stripped
      from IPv6 addresses, and &quot;::ffff:&quot; is removed from IPv6-mapped IPv4
      addresses (so strings can match them as simply IPv4 addresses);
    * ::1/128 is always included in the trusted_networks/internal_networks
      set similar to 127.0.0.0/8;

  <summary>Security update for glibc  </summary>
  <description>
The implementation of the blowfish based password hashing method had a bug 
affecting passwords that contain 8bit characters (e.g. umlauts). Affected 
passwords are potentially faster to crack via brute force methods 
(CVE-2011-2483).

SUSE&apos;s crypt() implementation supports the blowfish password hashing 
function (id $2a) and system logins by default also use this method. This 
update eliminates the bug in the $2a implementation. After installing the 
update existing $2a hashes therefore no longer match hashes generated with 
the new, correct implementation if the password contains 8bit characters. 
For system logins via PAM the pam_unix2 module activates a compat mode and 
keeps processing existing $2a hashes with the old algorithm. This ensures 
no user gets locked out. New passwords hashes are created with the id &quot;$2y&quot; 
to unambiguously identify them as generated with the correct 
implementation.

Note: To actually migrate hashes to the new algorithm all users are advised 
to change passwords after the update.

Services that do not use PAM but do use crypt() to store passwords using 
the blowfish hash do not have such a compat mode. That means users with 
8bit passwords that use such services will not be able to log in anymore 
after the update. As workaround administrators may edit the service&apos;s 
password database and change stored hashes from $2a to $2x. This will 
result in crypt() using the old algorithm. Users should be required to 
change their passwords to make sure they are migrated to the correct 
algorithm.

FAQ:

Q: I only use ASCII characters in passwords, am I a affected in any way?
A: No.

Q: What&apos;s the meaning of the ids before and after the update?
A: Before the update:
$2a -&gt; buggy algorithm

After the update:
$2x -&gt; buggy algorithm
$2a -&gt; correct algorithm
$2y -&gt; correct algorithm

System logins using PAM have a compat mode enabled by default:
$2x -&gt; buggy algorithm
$2a -&gt; buggy algorithm
$2y -&gt; correct algorithm

Q: How do I require users to change their password on next login?
A: Run the following command as root for each user:
chage -d 0

Q: I run an application that has $2a hashes in it&apos;s password database. Some 
users complain that they can not log in anymore.
A: Edit the password database and change the &quot;$2a&quot; prefix of the affected 
users&apos; hashes to &quot;$2x&quot;. They will be able to log in again but should change 
their password ASAP.

Q: How do I turn off the compat mode for system logins?
A: Set BLOWFISH_2a2x=no in /etc/default/passwd

The following security issues have been fixed in this update:

    * 

      Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory safety bugs in
      the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products.
      Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
      circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at least some
      of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. (MFSA 2012-01
      &lt;http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2012/mfsa2012-01.html&gt; , 
      CVE-2012-0442

      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-0443&gt; )

    * 

      Alex Dvorov reported that an attacker could replace a sub-frame in
      another domain&apos;s document by using the name attribute of the
      sub-frame as a form submission target. This can potentially allow for
      phishing attacks against users and violates the HTML5 frame
      navigation policy. (MFSA 2012-03
      &lt;http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2012/mfsa2012-03.html&gt; , 
      CVE-2012-0445
      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-0445&gt; )

    * 

      Security researcher regenrecht reported via TippingPoint&apos;s Zero Day
      Initiative that removed child nodes of nsDOMAttribute can be accessed
      under certain circumstances because of a premature notification of
      AttributeChildRemoved. This use-after-free of the child nodes could
      possibly allow for for remote code execution. (MFSA 2012-04
      &lt;http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2012/mfsa2012-04.html&gt; , 
      CVE-2011-3659
      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3659&gt; )

    * 

      Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reported that frame scripts
      bypass XPConnect security checks when calling untrusted objects. This
      allows for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks through web pages and
      Firefox extensions. The fix enables the Script Security Manager (SSM)
      to force security checks on all frame scripts. (MFSA 2012-05
      &lt;http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2012/mfsa2012-05.html&gt; , 
      CVE-2012-0446

    * 

      Mozilla developer Tim Abraldes reported that when encoding images as
      image/vnd.microsoft.icon the resulting data was always a fixed size,
      with uninitialized memory appended as padding beyond the size of the
      actual image. This is the result of mImageBufferSize in the encoder
      being initialized with a value different than the size of the source
      image. There is the possibility of sensitive data from uninitialized
      memory being appended to a PNG image when converted fron an ICO
      format image. This sensitive data may then be disclosed in the
      resulting image. ((MFSA 2012-06)

      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-0447&gt; )

    * 

      Security researcher regenrecht reported via TippingPoint&apos;s Zero Day
      Initiative the possibility of memory corruption during the decoding
      of Ogg Vorbis files. This can cause a crash during decoding and has
      the potential for remote code execution. (MFSA 2012-07

    * 

      Security researchers Nicolas Gregoire and Aki Helin independently
      reported that when processing a malformed embedded XSLT stylesheet,
      Firefox can crash due to a memory corruption. While there is no
      evidence that this is directly exploitable, there is a possibility of
      remote code execution. (MFSA 2012-08

    * 

      magicant starmen reported that if a user chooses to export their
      Firefox Sync key the &quot;Firefox Recovery Key.html&quot; file is saved with
      incorrect permissions, making the file contents potentially readable
      by other users on Linux and OS X systems. (MFSA 2012-09

  <summary>Security update for Linux kernel  </summary>
  <description>
The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP1 kernel was updated to 2.6.32.54, fixing 
lots of bugs and security issues.

The following security issues have been fixed:

    * CVE-2011-4127: A potential hypervisor escape by issuing SG_IO
      commands to partitiondevices was fixed by restricting access to these
      commands.
    * CVE-2011-4110: KEYS: Fix a NULL pointer deref in the user-defined key
      type, which allowed local attackers to Oops the kernel.
    * CVE-2011-4081: Avoid potential NULL pointer deref in ghash, which
      allowed local attackers to Oops the kernel.
    * CVE-2011-4077: Fixed a memory corruption possibility in xfs readlink,
      which could be used by local attackers to crash the system or
      potentially execute code by mounting a prepared xfs filesystem image.
    * CVE-2012-0038: A overflow in the xfs acl handling was fixed that
      could be used by local attackers to crash the system or potentially
      execute code by mounting a prepared xfs filesystem image.
    * CVE-2011-4132: A flaw in the ext3/ext4 filesystem allowed a local
      attacker to crash the kernel by getting a prepared ext3/ext4
      filesystem mounted.
    * CVE-2011-2494: Access to the taskstats /proc file was restricted to
      avoid local attackers gaining knowledge of IO of other users (and so
      effecting side-channel attacks for e.g. guessing passwords by typing
      speed).
    * CVE-2010-3873: When using X.25 communication a malicious sender could
      corrupt data structures, causing crashes or potential code execution.
      Please note that X.25 needs to be setup to make this effective, which
      these days is usually not the case.
    * CVE-2010-4164: When using X.25 communication a malicious sender could
      make the machine leak memory, causing crashes. Please note that X.25
      needs to be setup to make this effective, which these days is usually
      not the case.
    * CVE-2011-2699: A remote denial of service due to a NULL pointer
      dereference by using IPv6 fragments was fixed.

  <description>
This update fixes a regression in parameter passing (in urldecoding of 
parameters that contain spaces).

In addition, multiple weaknesses in HTTP DIGESTS have been fixed 
(CVE-2011-1184):

    * CVE-2011-5062: The HTTP Digest Access Authentication implementation
      in Apache Tomcat 5.5.x before 5.5.34, 6.x before 6.0.33 and 7.x
      before 7.0.12 does not check qop values, which might allow remote
      attackers to bypass intended integrity-protection requirements via a
      qop=auth value, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-1184.
    * CVE-2011-5063: The HTTP Digest Access Authentication implementation
      in Apache Tomcat 5.5.x before 5.5.34, 6.x before 6.0.33, and 7.x
      before 7.0.12 does not check realm values, which might allow remote
      attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the
      availability of a protection space with weaker authentication or
      authorization requirements, a different vulnerability than
      CVE-2011-1184.
    * CVE-2011-5064: DigestAuthenticator.java in the HTTP Digest Access
      Authentication implementation in Apache Tomcat 5.5.x before 5.5.34,
      6.x before 6.0.33, and 7.x before 7.0.12 uses Catalina as the
      hard-coded server secret (aka private key), which makes it easier for
      remote attackers to bypass cryptographic protection mechanisms by
      leveraging knowledge of this string, a different vulnerability than
      CVE-2011-1184.

  <summary>Security update for Mozilla XULrunner  </summary>
  <description>
Mozilla XULrunner was updated to 1.9.2.26 security update, fixing security 
issues and bugs. The following security bugs have been fixed:

    * 

      MFSA 2012-01: Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory
      safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other
      Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory
      corruption under certain circumstances, and we presume that with
      enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
      arbitrary code.

      In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
      Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but
      are potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those
      products. References

    * 

      CVE-2012-0442: Jesse Ruderman and Bob Clary reported memory safety
      problems that were fixed in both Firefox 10 and Firefox 3.6.26.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-02/CVE-2011-3670: For historical reasons Firefox has been
      generous in its interpretation of web addresses containing square
      brackets around the host. If this host was not a valid IPv6 literal
      address, Firefox attempted to interpret the host as a regular domain
      name. Gregory Fleischer reported that requests made using IPv6 syntax
      using XMLHttpRequest objects through a proxy may generate errors
      depending on proxy configuration for IPv6. The resulting error
      messages from the proxy may disclose sensitive data because
      Same-Origin Policy (SOP) will allow the XMLHttpRequest object to read
      these error messages, allowing user privacy to be eroded. Firefox now
      enforces RFC 3986 IPv6 literal syntax and that may break links
      written using the non-standard Firefox-only forms that were
      previously accepted.

      This was fixed previously for Firefox 7.0, Thunderbird 7.0, and
      SeaMonkey 2.4 but only fixed in Firefox 3.6.26 and Thunderbird 3.1.18
      during 2012.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-04/CVE-2011-3659: Security researcher regenrecht reported
      via TippingPoint&apos;s Zero Day Initiative that removed child nodes of
      nsDOMAttribute can be accessed under certain circumstances because of
      a premature notification of AttributeChildRemoved. This
      use-after-free of the child nodes could possibly allow for for remote
      code execution.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-07/CVE-2012-0444: Security researcher regenrecht reported
      via TippingPoint&apos;s Zero Day Initiative the possibility of memory
      corruption during the decoding of Ogg Vorbis files. This can cause a
      crash during decoding and has the potential for remote code
      execution.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-08/CVE-2012-0449: Security researchers Nicolas Gregoire and
      Aki Helin independently reported that when processing a malformed
      embedded XSLT stylesheet, Firefox can crash due to a memory
      corruption. While there is no evidence that this is directly
      exploitable, there is a possibility of remote code execution.

  <summary>Security update for Mozilla Firefox  </summary>
  <description>
MozillaFirefox was updated to 10.0.1 to fix critical bugs and security 
issue.

The following security issue has been fixed:

CVE-2012-0452: Mozilla developers Andrew McCreight and Olli Pettay found 
that ReadPrototypeBindings will leave a XBL binding in a hash table even 
when the function fails. If this occurs, when the cycle collector reads 
this hash table and attempts to do a virtual method on this binding a crash 
will occur. This crash may be potentially exploitable.

Firefox 9 and earlier are not affected by this vulnerability.

lxml is a Pythonic binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries. It 
follows the ElementTree API as much as possible, building it on top of the 
native libxml2 tree. It also extends this API to expose libxml2 and libxslt 
specific functionality, such as XPath, Relax NG, XML Schema, XSLT, and 
c14n.

  <description>
Mozilla Firefox was updated to 10.0.3 ESR to fix various bugs and security 
issues.

The following security issues have been fixed:

    * 

      MFSA 2012-19: Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory
      safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other
      Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory
      corruption under certain circumstances, and we presume that with
      enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
      arbitrary code.

      In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
      Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but
      are potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those
      products.

      References:

      Bob Clary reported two bugs that causes crashes that affected Firefox
      3.6, Firefox ESR, and Firefox 10. CVE-2012-0461

      Christian Holler, Jesse Ruderman, Nils, Michael Bebenita, Dindog, and
      David Anderson reported memory safety problems and crashes that
      affect Firefox ESR and Firefox 10. CVE-2012-0462

      Jeff Walden reported a memory safety problem in the array.join
      function. This bug was independently reported by Vincenzo Iozzo via
      TippingPoint&apos;s Zero Day Initiative Pwn2Own contest. CVE-2012-0464

      Masayuki Nakano reported a memory safety problem that affected Mobile
      Firefox

    * 

      CVE-2012-0463

    * 

      MFSA 2012-18 / CVE-2012-0460: Mozilla developer Matt Brubeck reported
      that window.fullScreen is writeable by untrusted content now that the
      DOM fullscreen API is enabled. Because window.fullScreen does not
      include mozRequestFullscreen&apos;s security protections, it could be used
      for UI spoofing. This code change makes window.fullScreen read only
      by untrusted content, forcing the use of the DOM fullscreen API in
      normal usage.

      Firefox 3.6 and Thunderbird 3.1 are not affected by this
      vulnerability.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-17 / CVE-2012-0459: Mozilla community member Daniel Glazman
      of Disruptive Innovations reported a crash when accessing a
      keyframe&apos;s cssText after dynamic modification. This crash may be
      potentially exploitable.

      Firefox 3.6 and Thunderbird 3.1 are not affected by this
      vulnerability.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-16 / CVE-2012-0458: Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski
      reported that an attacker able to convince a potential victim to set
      a new home page by dragging a link to the &quot;home&quot; button can set that
      user&apos;s home page to a javascript: URL. Once this is done the
      attacker&apos;s page can cause repeated crashes of the browser, eventually
      getting the script URL loaded in the privileged about:sessionrestore
      context.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-15 / CVE-2012-0451: Security Researcher Mike Brooks of
      Sitewatch reported that if multiple Content Security Policy (CSP)
      headers are present on a page, they have an additive effect page
      policy. Using carriage return line feed (CRLF) injection, a new CSP
      rule can be introduced which allows for cross-site scripting (XSS) on
      sites with a separate header injection vulnerability.

      Firefox 3.6 and Thunderbird 3.1 are not affected by this
      vulnerability.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-14 / CVE-2012-0457 / CVE-2012-0456: Security researcher
      Atte Kettunen from OUSPG found two issues with Firefox&apos;s handling of
      SVG using the Address Sanitizer tool. The first issue, critically
      rated, is a use-after-free in SVG animation that could potentially
      lead to arbitrary code execution. The second issue is rated moderate
      and is an out of bounds read in SVG Filters. This could potentially
      incorporate data from the user&apos;s memory, making it accessible to the
      page content.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-13 / CVE-2012-0455: Firefox prevents the dropping of
      javascript: links onto a frame to prevent malicious sites from
      tricking users into performing a cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks

      MFSA 2012-12 / CVE-2012-0454: Security researchers Blair Strang and
      Scott Bell of Security Assessment found that when a parent window
      spawns and closes a child window that uses the file open dialog, a
      crash can be induced in shlwapi.dll on 32-bit Windows 7 systems. This
      crash may be potentially exploitable.

      Firefox 3.6 and Thunderbird 3.1 are not affected by this
      vulnerability.

  <description>
A previous security update to coreutils changed su to start shells for &quot;su 
-c&quot; invocations in a separate session. As this caused interopability 
issues, this update adds back the old behavior as a non-default option:

    * 

      either via su -C , which is consistent with how su -c behaved before

    * 

      or by exporting SU_C_SAME_SESSION=1 as an environment variable before
      running su(1).

  <summary>Security update for Mozilla Firefox  </summary>
  <description>
MozillaFirefox was updated to the 10.0.4 ESR release to fix various bugs 
and security issues.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-20: Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory
      safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other
      Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory
      corruption under certain circumstances, and we presume that with
      enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
      arbitrary code.

      In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
      Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but
      are potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those
      products.

      Christian Holler a reported memory safety and security problem
      affecting Firefox 11. (CVE-2012-0468)

      Bob Clary, Christian Holler, Brian Hackett, Bobby Holley, Gary Kwong,
      Hilary Hall, Honza Bambas, Jesse Ruderman, Julian Seward, and Olli
      Pettay reported memory safety problems and crashes that affect
      Firefox ESR and Firefox 11. (CVE-2012-0467)

    * 

      MFSA 2012-22 / CVE-2012-0469: Using the Address Sanitizer tool,
      security researcher Aki Helin from OUSPG found that IDBKeyRange of
      indexedDB remains in the XPConnect hashtable instead of being
      unlinked before being destroyed. When it is destroyed, this causes a
      use-after-free, which is potentially exploitable.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-23 / CVE-2012-0470: Using the Address Sanitizer tool,
      security researcher Atte Kettunen from OUSPG found a heap corruption
      in gfxImageSurface which allows for invalid frees and possible remote
      code execution. This happens due to float error, resulting from
      graphics values being passed through different number systems.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-24 / CVE-2012-0471: Anne van Kesteren of Opera Software
      found a multi-octet encoding issue where certain octets will destroy
      the following octets in the processing of some multibyte character
      sets. This can leave users vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS)
      attacks on maliciously crafted web pages.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-25 / CVE-2012-0472: Security research firm iDefense
      reported that researcher wushi of team509 discovered a memory
      corruption on Windows Vista and Windows 7 systems with hardware
      acceleration disabled or using incompatible video drivers. This is
      created by using cairo-dwrite to attempt to render fonts on an
      unsupported code path. This corruption causes a potentially
      exploitable crash on affected systems.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-26 / CVE-2012-0473: Mozilla community member Matias
      Juntunen discovered an error in WebGLBuffer where
      FindMaxElementInSubArray receives wrong template arguments from
      FindMaxUshortElement. This bug causes maximum index to be computed
      incorrectly within WebGL.drawElements, allowing the reading of
      illegal video memory.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-27 / CVE-2012-0474: Security researchers Jordi Chancel and
      Eddy Bordi reported that they could short-circuit page loads to show
      the address of a different site than what is loaded in the window in
      the addressbar. Security researcher Chris McGowen independently
      reported the same flaw, and further demonstrated that this could lead
      to loading scripts from the attacker&apos;s site, leaving users vulnerable
      to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-28 / CVE-2012-0475: Security researcher Simone Fabiano
      reported that if a cross-site XHR or WebSocket is opened on a web
      server on a non-standard port for web traffic while using an IPv6
      address, the browser will send an ambiguous origin headers if the
      IPv6 address contains at least 2 consecutive 16-bit fields of zeroes.
      If there is an origin access control list that uses IPv6 literals,
      this issue could be used to bypass these access controls on the
      server.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-29 / CVE-2012-0477: Security researcher Masato Kinugawa
      found that during the decoding of ISO-2022-KR and ISO-2022-CN
      character sets, characters near 1024 bytes are treated incorrectly,
      either doubling or deleting bytes. On certain pages it might be
      possible for an attacker to pad the output of the page such that
      these errors fall in the right place to affect the structure of the
      page, allowing for cross-site script (XSS) injection.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-30 / CVE-2012-0478: Mozilla community member Ms2ger found
      an image rendering issue with WebGL when texImage2D uses use
      JSVAL_TO_OBJECT on arbitrary objects. This can lead to a crash on a
      maliciously crafted web page. While there is no evidence that this is
      directly exploitable, there is a possibility of remote code
      execution.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-31 / CVE-2011-3062: Mateusz Jurczyk of the Google Security
      Team discovered an off-by-one error in the OpenType Sanitizer using
      the Address Sanitizer tool. This can lead to an out-of-bounds read
      and execution of an uninitialized function pointer during parsing and
      possible remote code execution.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-32 / CVE-2011-1187: Security researcher Daniel Divricean
      reported that a defect in the error handling of javascript errors can
      leak the file names and location of javascript files on a server,
      leading to inadvertent information disclosure and a vector for
      further attacks.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-33 / CVE-2012-0479: Security researcher Jeroen van der Gun
      reported that if RSS or Atom XML invalid content is loaded over
      HTTPS, the addressbar updates to display the new location of the
      loaded resource, including SSL indicators, while the main window
      still displays the previously loaded content. This allows for
      phishing attacks where a malicious page can spoof the identify of
      another seemingly secure site.

  <summary>Recommended update for SMT  </summary>
  <description>
SMT and the SMT client have been enhanced with these new features:

An update job in the SMT JobQueue which requires a reboot returns with an 
error. This was intentionally designed like that to draw attention to this 
job. But even if a following child job is a reboot job it will never be 
executed.

To make this situation more comfortable the SMT admin now can decide what 
return values of a JobQueue job should be interpreted as success and thus 
should not block a job chain. Further it is possible to let an update job 
reboot the machine if required.

Please see the manpage for the new reboot policy.

Additionally SMT now requires the openssl-certs package to get the up to 
date CA certificates list used for Novell registration and update servers.

  <description>
The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP1 kernel has been updated to the 2.6.32.59 
stable release to fix a lot of bugs and security issues.

The following security issues have been fixed:

    * CVE-2012-2133: A use after free bug in hugetlb support could be used
      by local attackers to crash the system.
    * CVE-2012-1097: A null pointer dereference bug in the regsets proc
      file could be used by local attackers to perhaps crash the system.
      With mmap_min_addr is set and enabled, exploitation is unlikely.

This update to python 2.6.8 fixes the following bugs, among others:

    * XMLRPC Server DoS (CVE-2012-0845, bnc#747125)
    * hash randomization issues (CVE-2012-1150, bnc#751718)
    * insecure creation of .pypirc (CVE-2011-4944, bnc#754447)
    * SimpleHTTPServer XSS (CVE-2011-1015, bnc#752375)
    * functions can accept unicode kwargs (bnc#744287)
    * python MainThread lacks ident (bnc#754547)
    * TypeError: waitpid() takes no keyword arguments (bnc#751714)
    * Source code exposure in CGIHTTPServer module (CVE-2011-1015,
      bnc#674646)
    * Insecure redirect processing in urllib2 (CVE-2011-1521, bnc#682554)

The hash randomization fix is by default disabled to keep compatibility 
with existing python code when it extracts hashes.

To enable the hash seed randomization you can use: - pass -R to the python 
interpreter commandline. - set the environment variable 
PYTHONHASHSEED=random to enable it for programs. You can also set this 
environment variable to a fixed hash seed by specifying a integer value 
between 0 and MAX_UINT.

In generally enabling this is only needed when malicious third parties can 
inject values into your hash tables.

The update to 2.6.8 also provides many compatibility fixes with OpenStack.

This update fixes a security problem in sudo:

Multiple netmask values used in Host / Host_List configuration caused any 
host to be allowed access. (CVE-2012-2337)

Also a bug in wildcard matching could allow too relaxed matches within 
subdirectories of the specified path so /usr/bin/* would also match 
/usr/bin/X11/*, which is probably not intended. The behaviour was aligned 
to the one described in the sudoers manpage

  <description>
ecryptfs-utils was updated to fix a security issue and some bugs.

Security issue fixed: mount.ecryptfs_private did not set correct group 
ownerships when it modifies mtab (CVE-2011-3145).

Also some bugs that made this set of tools non-working were fixed.

You need to manually hand setuid root permissions to 
/sbin/mount.ecryptfs_private if you want to use it as a non-root user.

The audit daemon (auditd) would leak memory when log_format=NOLOG was

In addition, auditctl would fail to parse negative arguments for a0-a3

  <description>
Three security issues were found in XEN.

Two security issues are fixed by this update:

    * 

      CVE-2012-0217: Due to incorrect fault handling in the XEN hypervisor
      it was possible for a XEN guest domain administrator to execute code
      in the XEN host environment.

    * 

      CVE-2012-0218: Also a guest user could crash the guest XEN kernel due
      to a protection fault bounce.

The third fix is changing the Xen behaviour on certain hardware:

    * 

      CVE-2012-2934: The issue is a denial of service issue on older
      pre-SVM AMD CPUs (AMD Erratum 121).

      AMD Erratum #121 is described in &quot;Revision Guide for AMD Athlon 64
      and AMD Opteron Processors&quot;:
      http://support.amd.com/us/Processor_TechDocs/25759.pdf
      &lt;http://support.amd.com/us/Processor_TechDocs/25759.pdf&gt;

      The following 130nm and 90nm (DDR1-only) AMD processors are subject
      to this erratum:

          o 

            First-generation AMD-Opteron(tm) single and dual core
            processors in either 939 or 940 packages:

                + AMD Opteron(tm) 100-Series Processors
                + AMD Opteron(tm) 200-Series Processors
                + AMD Opteron(tm) 800-Series Processors
                + AMD Athlon(tm) processors in either 754, 939 or 940
                  packages
                + AMD Sempron(tm) processor in either 754 or 939 packages
                + AMD Turion(tm) Mobile Technology in 754 package

      This issue does not effect Intel processors.

      The impact of this flaw is that a malicious PV guest user can halt
      the host system.

      As this is a hardware flaw, it is not fixable except by upgrading
      your hardware to a newer revision, or not allowing untrusted 64bit
      guestsystems.

      The patch changes the behaviour of the host system booting, which
      makes it unable to create guest machines until a specific boot option
      is set.

      There is a new XEN boot option &quot;allow_unsafe&quot; for GRUB which allows
      the host to start guests again.

      This is added to /boot/grub/menu.lst in the line looking like this:

      kernel /boot/xen.gz .... allow_unsafe

      Note: .... in this example represents the existing boot options for
      the host.

  <summary>Security update for Mozilla Firefox  </summary>
  <description>
MozillaFirefox has been updated to 10.0.5ESR fixing various bugs and 
security issues.

    * 

      MFSA 2012-34
      Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory safety bugs in
      the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products.
      Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
      circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at least some
      of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

      In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
      Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but
      are potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those
      products. References

      Jesse Ruderman, Igor Bukanov, Bill McCloskey, Christian Holler,
      Andrew McCreight, and Brian Bondy reported memory safety problems and
      crashes that affect Firefox 12.(CVE-2012-1938)

      Christian Holler reported a memory safety problem that affects
      Firefox ESR. (CVE-2012-1939)

      Igor Bukanov, Olli Pettay, Boris Zbarsky, and Jesse Ruderman reported
      memory safety problems and crashes that affect Firefox ESR and
      Firefox 13. (CVE-2012-1937)

      Ken Russell of Google reported a bug in NVIDIA graphics drivers that
      they needed to work around in the Chromium WebGL implementation.
      Mozilla has done the same in Firefox 13 and ESR 10.0.5.
      (CVE-2011-3101)

    * 

      MFSA 2012-35
      Security researcher James Forshaw of Context Information Security
      found two issues with the Mozilla updater and the Mozilla updater
      service introduced in Firefox 12 for Windows. The first issue allows
      Mozilla&apos;s updater to load a local DLL file in a privileged context.
      The updater can be called by the Updater Service or independently on
      systems that do not use the service. The second of these issues
      allows for the updater service to load an arbitrary local DLL file,
      which can then be run with the same system privileges used by the
      service. Both of these issues require local file system access to be
      exploitable.

      Possible Arbitrary Code Execution by Update Service (CVE-2012-1942)
      Updater.exe loads wsock32.dll from application directory
      (CVE-2012-1943)

    * 

      MFSA 2012-36
      Security researcher Adam Barth found that inline event handlers, such
      as onclick, were no longer blocked by Content Security Policy&apos;s (CSP)
      inline-script blocking feature. Web applications relying on this
      feature of CSP to protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) were not
      fully protected. (CVE-2012-1944)

    * 

      MFSA 2012-37
      Security researcher Paul Stone reported an attack where an HTML page
      hosted on a Windows share and then loaded could then load Windows
      shortcut files (.lnk) in the same share. These shortcut files could
      then link to arbitrary locations on the local file system of the
      individual loading the HTML page. That page could show the contents
      of these linked files or directories from the local file system in an
      iframe, causing information disclosure.

      This issue could potentially affect Linux machines with samba shares
      enabled. (CVE-2012-1945)

    * 

      MFSA 2012-38
      Security researcher Arthur Gerkis used the Address Sanitizer tool to
      find a use-after-free while replacing/inserting a node in a document.
      This use-after-free could possibly allow for remote code execution.
      (CVE-2012-1946)

    * 

      MFSA 2012-39
      Security researcher Kaspar Brand found a flaw in how the Network
      Security Services (NSS) ASN.1 decoder handles zero length items.
      Effects of this issue depend on the field. One known symptom is an
      unexploitable crash in handling OCSP responses. NSS also mishandles
      zero-length basic constraints, assuming default values for some types
      that should be rejected as malformed. These issues have been
      addressed in NSS 3.13.4, which is now being used by Mozilla.
      (CVE-2012-0441)

    * 

      MFSA 2012-40
      Security researcher Abhishek Arya of Google used the Address
      Sanitizer tool to uncover several issues: two heap buffer overflow
      bugs and a use-after-free problem. The first heap buffer overflow was
      found in conversion from unicode to native character sets when the
      function fails. The use-after-free occurs in nsFrameList when working
      with column layout with absolute positioning in a container that
      changes size. The second buffer overflow occurs in nsHTMLReflowState
      when a window is resized on a page with nested columns and a
      combination of absolute and relative positioning. All three of these
      issues are potentially exploitable.

      Heap-buffer-overflow in utf16_to_isolatin1 (CVE-2012-1947)
      Heap-use-after-free in nsFrameList::FirstChild (CVE-2012-1940)

      Heap-buffer-overflow in nsHTMLReflowState::CalculateHypotheticalBox,
      with nested multi-column, relative position, and absolute position
      (CVE-2012-1941)

  <summary>Feature update for pciutils  </summary>
  <description>
This update provides pciutils 3.1.7, which improves correctness and 
completeness of information reporting for VF devices.

    * All extended capabilities have their version displayed (-vv or more).
    * When scanning extended capabilities, properly mask the lowest 2 bits,
      which are currently reserved. This avoids unaligned access errors on
      broken hardware (see tests/broken-ecaps).
    * Large bar sizes are displayed in human-readable format (with units).
    * The SR-IOV capability decoder now prints the VF BAR&apos;s.
    * The VPD parser now reports unknown and vendor-defined items properly.
      It also stops on any item in unknown format, avoiding long output on
      bogus VPD data
    * The Power Management capability now includes the soft reset bit.
    * Decoding of the Advanced Features capability has been added.
    * The procfs back-end is able to cope with /proc/bus/pci containing
      names with domains, which occur on sparc64 and possibly other
      architectures due to a kernel bug.
    * The MSI and MSI-X capabilities are printed in a prettier way.
    * When a BAR is reported by the OS, but not by the device (i.e., it is
      marked as [virtual] in lspci), the [disabled] flag is suppressed,
      because it does not make sense in such cases.
    * When a device has the VPD (Vital Product Data) capability and the VPD
      data are supplied by the OS, they are decoded and printed in the
      verbose mode. This currently works only on Linux with the sysfs
      back-end.
    * The setpci utility is now able to address registers stored in PCI
      capabilities (actually it allows a more general form of relative
      addressing).
    * The library has gained functions for working with PCI capabilities.
    * Fixed printing of the AER capability.

    * CVE-2012-1146: A local attacker could oops the kernel using memory
      control groups and eventfds.
    * CVE-2011-1083: Limit the path length users can build using epoll() to
      avoid local attackers consuming lots of kernel CPU time.
    * CVE-2012-1097: The regset common infrastructure assumed that regsets
      would always have .get and .set methods, but necessarily .active
      methods. Unfortunately people have since written regsets without .set
      method, so NULL pointer dereference attacks were possible.
    * CVE-2011-2494: Access to the /proc/pid/taskstats file requires root
      access to avoid side channel (timing keypresses etc.) attacks on
      other users.
    * CVE-2011-4086: Fixed a oops in jbd/jbd2 that could be caused by
      specific filesystem access patterns.

      the nfsv4 acl handling.
    * CVE-2011-4132: Fixed a oops in jbd/jbd2 that could be caused by
      mounting a malicious prepared filesystem.

  <summary>Recommended update for smt-client  </summary>
  <description>
SMT and the SMT client has been enhanced with these new features:

    * 

      An update job in the SMT JobQueue which requires a reboot returns
      with an error. This was desinged like this intentionally to draw
      attention to this job. But even if a following child job is a reboot
      job it will never be executed.

      To make this situation more comfortable the SMT admin now can decide
      what return values of a JobQueue job should be interpreted as success
      and thus should not block a job chain. Further it is possible to let
      an update job reboot the machine if required.

      Please see the manpage for the new reboot policy.

    * 

      Additionally SMT now requires the openssl-certs package to get the up
      to date CA certificates list used for Novell registration and update
      servers.

  <description>
The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP2 kernel was updated to 3.0.31, fixing many 
bugs and security issues.

Various security and bug fixes contained in the Linux 3.0 stable releases 
3.0.27 up to 3.0.31 have been included, but are not explicitly listed 
below.

The following notable security issues have been fixed:

    * The dl2k network card driver lacked permission handling for some
      ethtool ioctls, which could allow local attackers to start/stop the
      network card. (CVE-2012-2313
      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-2313&gt; )
    * A use after free bug in hugetlb support could be used by local
      attackers to crash the system. (CVE-2012-2133
      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-2133&gt; )
    * Various leaks in namespace handling over fork where fixed, which
      could be exploited by e.g. vsftpd access by remote users. (
      CVE-2012-2127
      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-2127&gt; )
    * A memory corruption when mounting a hfsplus filesystem was fixed that
      could be used by local attackers able to mount filesystem to crash
      the system. (CVE-2012-2319
      &lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-2319&gt; )

This update for nfs-client includes the following changes:

      multiple processes in parallel overwriting each other.
    * Fixes issues with NFSv4 pseudo root management which was interfering
      with using different types of host identifiers (e.g. netgroup vs IP
      address) on different exports.
    * Removes a duplicate MOUNTD_PORT variable from sysconfig/nfs.

The audit daemon (auditd) would leak memory when log_format=NOLOG was

when forwarding log information to other hosts via the network rather than 
performing local logging.

In addition, auditctl would fail to parse negative arguments for a0-a3

This collective update for Xen 2012/06 on SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP2 
provides the following fixes:


Xen

    * 757537: xen: CVE-2012-0217 PV guest escalation
    * 757970: xen: CVE-2012-0218 guest denial of service on syscall GPF
      generation
    * 

      764077: xen: CVE-2012-2934 Report a denial of service issue on old,
      pre-SVM AMD CPUs (AMD Erratum 121).

      AMD Erratum #121 is described in &quot;Revision Guide for AMD Athlon 64
      and AMD Opteron Processors&quot;:
      http://support.amd.com/us/Processor_TechDocs/25759.pdf
      &lt;http://support.amd.com/us/Processor_TechDocs/25759.pdf&gt;

      The following 130nm and 90nm (DDR1-only) AMD processors are subject
      to this erratum:

          o 

            First-generation AMD-Opteron(tm) single and dual core
            processors in either 939 or 940 packages:

                + AMD Opteron(tm) 100-Series Processors
                + AMD Opteron(tm) 200-Series Processors
                + AMD Opteron(tm) 800-Series Processors
                + AMD Athlon(tm) processors in either 754, 939 or 940
                  packages
                + AMD Sempron(tm) processor in either 754 or 939 packages
                + AMD Turion(tm) Mobile Technology in 754 package

      This issue does not effect Intel processors.

      The impact of this flaw is that a malicious PV guest user can halt
      the host system.

      As this is a hardware flaw, it is not fixable except by upgrading
      your hardware to a newer revision, or not allowing untrusted 64bit
      guestsystems.

      The patch changes the behaviour of the host system booting, which
      makes it unable to create guest machines until a specific boot option
      is set.

      There is a new XEN boot option &quot;allow_unsafe&quot; for GRUB which allows
      the host to start guests again.

      This is added to /boot/grub/menu.lst in the line looking like this:

      kernel /boot/xen.gz .... allow_unsafe

      or add this option to the XEN_APPEND line /etc/sysconfig/bootloader,
      like e.g.:

      XEN_APPEND=&quot;allow_unsafe&quot;

      Note: .... in the first example represents the existing boot options
      for the host.

    * 

      753165: xen/scripts/network-bridge wont create bridge

    * 745880: cpuid setting is not preserved across xend restarts
    * 747331: standard &quot;newburn&quot; kernel QA stress test freezes the guest
